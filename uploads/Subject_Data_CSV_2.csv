This building block is what we call an Atom. Inside an atom are protons, electrons and neutrons. Out of the three, electrons and protons fit the definition of an electric charge. The protons are positively charged, the electrons are negatively charged, and the neutrons are neutral. A majority of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a very tiny space in the centre called the nucleus and the electrons revolve around this heavy nucleus.",1,0,0,0,0
2,Electrochemitry,"Electrochemistry is the subdiscipline of Chemistry that deals with the study of the relationship between electrical energy and chemical changes. Chemical reactions that involve the input or generation of electric currents are called electrochemical reactions. Such reactions are broadly classified into two categories: Electricity can be produced when electrons move from one element to another in certain types of reactions (such as redox reactions). Typically, electrochemistry deals with the overall reactions when multiple redox reactions occur simultaneously, connected via some external electric current and a suitable electrolyte. In other words, electrochemistry is also concerned with chemical phenomena that involve charge separation (as seen commonly in liquids such as solutions). The dissociation of charge often involves charge transfer that occurs homogeneously or heterogeneously between different chemical species.",0,1,0,0,0

4,Conductors and insulators ,"In simple terms, an electrical conductor is defined as materials that allow electricity to flow through them easily. This property of conductors that allow them to conduct electricity is known as conductivity.
The flow of electrons in a conductor is known as the electric current. The force required to make that current flow through the conductor is known as voltage.
When a charge is transferred to such an element, it gets distributed across the entire surface of the object, which results in the movement of electrons in the object. The charges transferred to an electrical conductor    distribute until the force of repulsion between electrons in areas of excess electrons is decreased to the minimum value. When such an object is brought in contact with another conductor, the charge gets transferred from the first conductor to the other until the overall repulsion due to charge is minimized.Insulators are materials that hinder the free flow of electrons from one particle of the element to another. If we transfer some amount of charge to such an element at any point, the charge remains at the initial location and does not get distributed across the surface. The most common process of charging of such elements is charging by rubbing (for some elements, with the help of suitable materials).
Metals, humans, and earth are all conductors. This is the reason why we get electric shocks!",1,0,0,0,0
5,Eccentricity ,"The eccentricity in the conic section uniquely characterises the shape where it should possess a non-negative real number. In general, eccentricity means a measure of how much the deviation of the curve has occurred from the circularity of the given shape. We know that the section obtained after the intersection of a plane with the cone is called the conic section. We will get different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the intersection of the plane with respect to the plane and the angle made by the vertical axis of the cone. In terms of fixed-point called focus and the fixed-line called the directrix in the plane, the term “eccentricity” is defined. In this article, we are going to discuss the eccentric meaning in geometry, and eccentricity formula and the eccentricity of different conic sections such as parabola, ellipse and hyperbola The eccentric meaning in geometry represents the distance from any point on the conic section to the focus divided by the perpendicular distance from that point to the nearest directrix. Generally, the eccentricity helps to determine the curvature of the shape. If the curvature decreases, the eccentricity increases. Similarly, if the curvature increases, the eccentricity decreases. We know that there are different conics such as a parabola, ellipse, hyperbola and circle. The eccentricity of the conic section is defined as the distance from any point to its focus, divided by the perpendicular distance from that point to its nearest directrix. The eccentricity value is constant for any conics. The letter used to represent eccentricity is “e”.",0,0,1,0,0
6,Introduction to Biology,"Biological data refers to a compound or information derived from living organisms and their products. A medicinal compound made from living organisms, such as a serum or a vaccine, could be characterized as biological data. Biological data is highly complex when compared with other forms of data. There are many forms of biological data, including text, sequence data, protein structure, genomic data and amino acids, and links among others. Biological data works closely with bioinformatics, which is a recent discipline focusing on addressing the need to analyze and interpret vast amounts of genomic data.

In the past few decades, leaps in genomic research have led to massive amounts of biological data. As a result, bioinformatics was created as the convergence of genomics, biotechnology, and information technology, while concentrating on biological data.

Biological data has also been difficult to define, as bioinformatics is a wide-encompassing field. Further, the question of what constitutes as being a living organism has been contentious, as ""alive"" represents a nebulous term that encompasses molecular evolution, biological modeling, biophysics, and systems biology. From the past decade onwards, bioinformatics and the analysis of biological data have been thriving as a result of leaps in technology required to manage and interpret data. It is currently a thriving field, as society has become more concentrated on the acquisition, transfer, and exploitation of bioinformatics and biological data.        ",0,0,0,1,0
7,Chemical equilibrium,"Chemical equilibrium refers to the state of a system in which the concentration of the reactant and the concentration of the products do not change with time, and the system does not display any further change in properties.When the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction, the state of chemical equilibrium is achieved by the system. When there is no further change in the concentrations of the reactants and the products due to the equal rates of the forward and reverse reactions, the system is said to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium.Change in Pressure
Change in pressure happens due to the change in the volume. If there is a change in pressure, it can affect the gaseous reaction as the total number of gaseous reactants and products are now different. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, in heterogeneous chemical equilibrium, the change of pressure in both liquids and solids can be ignored because the volume is independent of pressure.Change in Temperature
The effect of temperature on chemical equilibrium depends upon the sign of ?H of the reaction and follows Le-Chatelier’s Principle.

As temperature increases, the equilibrium constant of an exothermic reaction decreases.
In an endothermic reaction, the equilibrium constant increases with an increase in temperature.
Along with the equilibrium constant, the rate of reaction is also affected by the change in temperature. As per Le Chatelier’s principle, the equilibrium shifts towards the reactant side when the temperature increases in the case of exothermic reactions; for endothermic reactions, the equilibrium shifts towards the product side with an increase in temperature.

8,OSI Model,"OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection , where open stands to say non-proprietary. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. The OSI reference model was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization ‘, in the year 1984.

The OSI model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding network communication . However, it is usually not directly implemented in its entirety in real-world networking hardware or software . Instead, specific protocols and technologies are often designed based on the principles outlined in the OSI model to facilitate efficient data transmission and networking operations.When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender’s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver’s end.

Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:

Application Layer: Applications create the data.
Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.

Linear Algebra is divided into different branches based on the difficulty level of topics, which are,

Elementary Linear Algebra
Advanced Linear Algebra
Applied Linear Algebra.Elementary Linear Algebra
Elementary Linear algebra covers the topics of basic linear algebra such as Scalars and Vectors, Matrix and matrix operation, etc.

Linear Equations
Linear equations form the basis of linear algebra and are equations of the first order. These equations represent straight lines in geometry and are characterized by constants and variables without exponents or products of variables. Solving systems of linear equations involves finding the values of the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.Advanced Linear Algebra
Advanced linear algebra mostly covers all the advanced topics related to linear algebra such as Linear function, Linear transformation, Eigenvectors, and Eigenvalues, etc.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra. It offers deep insights into the properties of linear transformations. An eigenvector of a square matrix is a non-zero vector that, when the matrix multiplies it, results in a scalar multiple of itself. This scalar is known as the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector. They are essential in various applications, including stability analysis, quantum mechanics, and the study of dynamical systems.

Consider a transformation that changes the direction or length of vectors, except for some special vectors that only get stretched or shrunk. These special vectors are eigenvectors, and the factor by which they are stretched or shrunk is the eigenvalue.Singular Value Decomposition
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a powerful mathematical technique used in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. It decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, where one represents the rotation, another the scaling, and the third the final rotation. It’s essential for identifying the intrinsic geometric structure of data.

Vector Space in Linear Algebra
A vector space (or linear space) is a collection of vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (“scaled”) by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often real numbers, but can also be complex numbers. Vector spaces are central to the study of linear algebra and are used in various scientific fields.

Basic vectors in Linear Algebra
Linear Map
A linear map (or linear transformation) is a mapping between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. The concept is central to linear algebra and has significant implications in geometry and abstract algebra.

A linear map is a way of moving vectors around in a space that keeps the grid lines parallel and evenly spaced.Matrix Exponential
The matrix exponential is a function on square matrices analogous to the exponential function for real numbers. It is used in solving systems of linear differential equations, among other applications in physics and engineering.

Matrix exponentials stretch or compress spaces in ways that depend smoothly on time, much like how interest grows continuously in a bank account.Linear Computations
Linear computations involve numerical methods for solving linear algebra problems, including systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors calculations. These computations are essential in computer simulations, optimisations, and modelling.

These are techniques for crunching numbers in linear algebra problems, like finding the best-fit line through a set of points or solving systems of equations quickly and accurately.

Linear Independence
A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of the others. The concept of linear independence is central to the study of vector spaces, as it helps define bases and dimension.

Vectors are linearly independent if none of them can be made by combining the others. It’s like saying each vector brings something unique to the table that the others don’t.Linear Subspace
A linear subspace (or simply subspace) is a subset of a vector space that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. A subspace is a smaller space that lies within a larger vector space, following the same rules of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Example: The set of all vectors of the form a, 0 in 2D space is a subspace, representing all points along the x-axis.


Applied Linear Algebra 
In Applied Linear Algebra, the topics covered are generally the practical implications of Elementary and advanced linear Algebra topics such as the Complement of a matrix, matrix factorization and norm of vectors, etc.

This is a technique for optimizing (maximizing or minimizing) a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. It’s like planning the best outcome under given restrictions.Linear Equation Systems
Systems of linear equations involve multiple linear equations that share the same set of variables. The solution to these systems is the set of values that satisfy all equations simultaneously, which can be found using various methods, including substitution, elimination, and matrix operations.Gaussian Elimination
Gaussian elimination is a systematic method for solving systems of linear equations. It involves applying a series of operations to transform the system’s matrix into its row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, making it easier to solve for the variables. It is a step-by-step procedure to simplify a system of linear equations into a form that’s easier to solve.Vectors in Linear Algebra
In linear algebra, vectors are fundamental mathematical objects that represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction.

Vectors operations like addition and scalar multiplication are mainly used concepts in linear algebra. They can be used to solve systems of linear equations and represent linear transformation, and perform matrix operations such as multiplication and inverse matrices.
The representation of many physical processes’ magnitude and direction using vectors, a fundamental component of linear algebra, is essential.
In linear algebra, vectors are elements of a vector space that can be scaled and added. Essentially, they are arrows with a length and direction.
Linear Function
A formal definition of a linear function is provided below:


f(ax) = af(x), and f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)
Linear Algebra Matrix
A linear matrix in algebra is a rectangular array of integers organized in rows and columns in linear algebra. The letters a, b, c, and other similar letters are commonly used to represent the integers that make up a matrix’s entries.
Matrices are often used to represent linear transformation, such as scaling, rotation, and reflection.
Its size is determined by the rows and columns that are present.
A matrix has three rows and two columns, for instance. A matrix is referred to as be 3×2 matrix, for instance, if it contains three rows and two columns.
Matrix basically works on operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The appropriate elements are simply added or removed when matrices are added or subtracted.
Scalar multiplication involves multiplying every entry in the matrix by a scalar(a number).
Matrix multiplication is a more complex operation that involves multiplying and adding certain entries in the matrices.
The number of columns and rows in the matrix determines its size. For instance, a matrix with 4 rows and 2 columns is known as a 4×2 matrix. The entries in the matrix are integers, and they are frequently represented by letters like u, v, and w.Numerical Linear Algebra
Numerical linear algebra, also called applied linear algebra, explores how matrix operations can solve real-world problems using computers. It focuses on creating efficient algorithms for continuous mathematics tasks. These algorithms are vital for solving problems like least-square optimization, finding Eigenvalues, and solving systems of linear equations. In numerical linear algebra, various matrix decomposition methods such as Eigen decomposition, Single value decomposition, and QR factorization are utilized to tackle these challenges.Linear Algebra Applications

1. Computer Graphics and Animation
Linear algebra is indispensable in computer graphics, gaming, and animation. It helps in transforming the shapes of objects and their positions in scenes through rotations, translations, scaling, and more. For instance, when animating a character, linear transformations are used to rotate limbs, scale objects, or shift positions within the virtual world.

In machine learning, linear algebra is at the heart of algorithms used for classifying information, making predictions, and understanding the structures within data. It’s crucial for operations in high-dimensional data spaces, optimizing algorithms, and even in the training of neural networks where matrix and tensor operations define the efficiency and effectiveness of learning.

3. Quantum Mechanics
The state of quantum systems is described using vectors in a complex vector space. Linear algebra enables the manipulation and prediction of these states through operations such as unitary transformations (evolution of quantum states) and eigenvalue problems (energy levels of quantum systems).

4. Cryptography
Linear algebraic concepts are used in cryptography for encoding messages and ensuring secure communication. Public key cryptosystems, such as RSA, rely on operations that are easy to perform but extremely difficult to reverse without the key, many of which involve linear algebraic computations.

5. Control Systems
In engineering, linear algebra is used to model and design control systems. The behavior of systems, from simple home heating systems to complex flight control mechanisms, can be modeled using matrices that describe the relationships between inputs, outputs, and the system’s state.

6. Network Analysis
Linear algebra is used to analyze and optimize networks, including internet traffic, social networks, and logistical networks. Google’s PageRank algorithm, which ranks web pages based on their links to and from other sites, is a famous example that uses the eigenvectors of a large matrix representing the web.

7. Image and Signal Processing
Techniques from linear algebra are used to compress, enhance, and reconstruct images and signals.

10,Human Brain,"The human brain controls nearly every aspect of the human body ranging from physiological functions to cognitive abilities. It functions by receiving and sending signals via neurons to different parts of the body. The human brain, just like most other mammals, has the same basic structure, but it is better developed than any other mammalian brain. On average, an adult brain weighs between 1.0 kg – 1.5 kg.  It is mainly composed of neurons – the fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system. Recent estimates have suggested that the brain contains anywhere between 86 billion to 100 billion neurons.The brain is enclosed within the skull, which provides frontal, lateral and dorsal protection. The skull consists of 22 bones, 14 of which form the facial bones and the remaining 8 form the cranial bones. Anatomically, the brain is contained within the cranium and is surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid.

The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is a fluid that circulates within the skull and spinal cord, filling up hollow spaces on the surface of the brain. Every day, the specialised ependymal cells produce around 500mL of cerebrospinal fluid.

The primary function of the CSF is to act as a buffer for the brain, cushioning mechanical shocks and dampening minor jolts. It also provides basic immunological protection to the brain.

Furthermore, CSF provides buoyancy for the brain. i.e., the brain is suspended in a layer of CSF, wherein, the weight of the brain is nearly negated. If the brain is not suspended in CSF, it would be impeded by its weight, consequently cutting off the blood supply in the lower half of the brain. It would lead to the death of neurons in the affected area.
The brain, along with the spinal cord, constitutes the central nervous system. It is responsible for thoughts, interpretation and origin of control for body movements.",0,0,0,1,0
11,Biomolecules,"Biomolecules are the most essential organic molecules, which are involved in the maintenance and metabolic processes of living organisms. These non-living molecules are the actual foot-soldiers of the battle of sustenance of life. They range from small molecules such as primary and secondary metabolites and hormones to large macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids etc.Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are chemically defined as polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or compounds which produce them on hydrolysis. In layman’s terms, we acknowledge carbohydrates as sugars or substances that taste sweet. They are collectively called as saccharides (Greek: sakcharon = sugar). Depending on the number of constituting sugar units obtained upon hydrolysis, they are classified as monosaccharides (1 unit), oligosaccharides (2-10 units) and polysaccharides (more than 10 units). They have multiple functions’ viz. they’re the most abundant dietary source of energy; they are structurally very important for many living organisms as they form a major structural component, e.g. cellulose is an important structural fibre for plants.Proteins are another class of indispensable biomolecules, which make up around 50per cent of the cellular dry weight. Proteins are polymers of amino acids arranged in the form of polypeptide chains. The structure of proteins is classified as primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary in some cases. These structures are based on the level of complexity of the folding of a polypeptide chain. Proteins play both structural and dynamic roles. Myosin is the protein that allows movement by contraction of muscles. Most enzymes are proteinaceous in nature. Nucleic acids refer to the genetic material found in the cell that carries all the hereditary information from parents to progeny. There are two types of nucleic acids namely, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The main function of nucleic acid is the transfer of genetic information and synthesis of proteins by processes known as translation and transcription. The monomeric unit of nucleic acids is known as nucleotide and is composed of a nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, and phosphate. The nucleotides are linked by a 3’ and 5’ phosphodiester bond. The nitrogen base attached to the pentose sugar makes the nucleotide distinct. There are 4 major nitrogenous bases found in DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. The DNA structure is described as a double-helix or double-helical structure which is formed by hydrogen bonding between the bases of two antiparallel polynucleotide chains. Overall, the DNA structure looks similar to a twisted ladder.Lipids are organic substances that are insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents, are related to fatty acids and are utilized by the living cell. They include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, mono-, di- or triglycerides, phospholipids, etc. Unlike carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids, lipids are not polymeric molecules. Lipids play a great role in the cellular structure and are the chief source of energy.",0,1,0,0,0
12,Chemical Compound,"The chemical formula of a compound is a symbolic representation of its chemical composition. Chemical formulae provide insight into the elements that constitute the molecules of a compound and also the ratio in which the atoms of these elements combine to form such molecules. For example, the chemical formula of water, which is H2O, suggests that two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom to form one molecule of water.Chemical formulae provide insight into the chemical composition of a compound.
They also represent the ratios in which the constituent elements combine to form the compound.
The chemical formula of a compound is crucial while representing it in a chemical equation.
Chemical formulae can also be employed to represent ions, free radicals and other chemical species.Types of Chemical Formulae,Molecular Formula:
The molecular formula provides insight into the number of elements present in a compound. In molecular formulae, the elements are denoted by their respective symbols (as in the periodic table) and the number of atoms of each element in the molecule is written in subscript. For example- the molecular formula for glucose is C6H12O6.The empirical formula of a chemical compound represents the ratio of the elements present in that compound. Empirical formulae are usually obtained based on the analysis of experimental data. The empirical formula for glucose is CH2O. Empirical Formulae can be derived from the molecular formulae.",0,1,0,0,0
13,Introduction to SQL,"SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data. Therefore, SQL is the underlying programming language for all relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase, among others.SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:

Columns: Each column holds specific attribute information, and column properties define the data type (for example, numeric or textual data) and range it can accept. Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify an entity. A specific column, for example, Customer ID in a customer data table, can be the primary key.
Rows: Database users can add data to each row and execute SQL queries to retrieve data. For the primary key, each row holds a unique value which also helps overcome data duplication challenges.SQL databases serve as a cornerstone for several applications and services across industries. Enterprises rely on SQL database servers for storing and retrieving data as it facilitates a broad range of operational capabilities, including transaction processing, analytics, and business intelligence required to manage business-critical applications.

Relational databases contain multiple tables with relevant columns (Attribute) and rows (Record) along with a unique primary key. When the user executes a query, it either updates or modifies the data in the database or retrieves the relevant results for specific queries after checking constraints.

Users can leverage SQL databases to get meaningful information by joining various tables to understand the context and data relationships better. SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.",0,0,0,0,1
14,Electric Charge,"It is to be noted that the charged bodies in a system of charges that are very small as compared to the distance between them are treated as point charges. In such bodies, all the charges distributed over the surface of the object are assumed to be concentrated at one point. Very often, we get to deal with systems where the influence of many such systems has to be taken into consideration. In order to calculate the final effect in such cases, we need to add and subtract these charges from one another. In order to simplify the operations involved, it is necessary to study the properties of point charges. In this section, we will learn about three such properties of point charges; the additivity of electric charge, the conservation of electric charge, and the quantization of electric charge.According to the principle of conservation of charges, the charges are neither created nor destroyed; they are only transferred from one body to the other. For example, when two objects, one has some charge and the other having no charge are made to come in contact with each other, the charge is transferred from the object possessing some charge to the object possessing no charge until the charge is equally distributed over the whole system. Here, no charge is created or lost and is only transferred from the one possessing an excess of charge to the other possessing a deficit.According to the principle of quantization of electric charge, all the free charges are integral multiples of a basic predefined unit, which we denote by e. Thus, the charge possessed by a system can be given as,Electric charge

Some other mathematical logics are implication and double implication.Conjunction,In mathematical logic conjunction of two statements results in true when both the statements are true otherwise false. Conjunction is also known as AND operator and is represented by ?. Disjunction In mathematical logic disjunction of two statements results in false if both the statements are false otherwise true. Disjunction is also known as OR operator and is represented by ?.Negation ,In mathematical logic negation of two statements results in the not of the given statement i.e., if the statement is true it results in false and if the statement is false it results in true. Negation is also known as NOT operator and is represented by ~ or ¬. Implication

Implication is also known as conditional operator and is represented by ? or ?. Implication X?Y is read as If X and then Y.Double Implication ,In mathematical logic double implication of two statements results in true when either both statements are true or both statements are false.

16,Catalysis,"Catalysis in Chemistry is defined as the process in which the rate of the reaction is influenced by the presence of some specific substance. These specific substances are called Catalysts. The catalyst is never consumed during the chemical reaction.A catalyst changes the activation energy of the reaction, i.e. the energy required for occurring the reaction. and thus alters its rate. In general, a catalyst lowers the activation energy of the chemical reaction and this process is called the Catalysis.What is Catalysis in Chemistry?
Catalysis is a process that can speed up and slow down a chemical reaction. The substance which cause the change in rate of recation without being consumed at the end of the reaction.

Catalysis in chemistry is a process that increase or decrease the rate of a chemical reaction caused by the inclusion of a catalyst, which is not consumed in the chemical reaction and is used multiple times.Every chemical reaction proceeds after overtaking a certain energy and this energy is called the Activation Energy of the reaction. The catalyst alters the Activation Energy of the chemical reaction and increases and decreases the rate of the reaction.

Catalysis Definition
Catalysis is the generally defined as the process that increases the rate of the reaction and makes the chemical reaction faster. Catalysis Example
The example of Catalysis is mentioned in the following reactions:

\mathrm{N}_2(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_2(g) \stackrel{\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{s})}{\longrightarrow} 2 \mathrm{NO}_3(g) 

2 \mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{~g}) \stackrel{\mathrm{V}_2 \mathrm{O}_5(\mathrm{~s})}{\longrightarrow} 2 \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathrm{~g}) 

Mechanism of Catalysis
We know that a catalyst decreases the activation energy of the reaction and increases the rate of the reaction. The mechanism of the catalysis is defined by a five-step process that is added below,

Step 1: Firstly reactant molecule is diffused on the catalytic surface.

Step 2: Now the reactant molecules get adsorped on the catalytic surface.

Step 3: Then the intermediate molecules are formed on the catalytic surface.

Step 4: Then desorption of the product molecule do formed by the catalytic surface.

Step 5: Now at last the diffusion of product molecules from the catalytic surface to form Final product.

Types of Catalysis
Catalysis are easily categerozied into two different categories that are,

Homogeneous Catalysis
Hetrogenous CatalysisHomogeneous Catalysis
When the reactants and catalyst are in the same phase with respect to each other (i.e. solid, liquid or gas). It is claimed that the catalysis is homogeneous. 

Some examples of homogeneous catalysis are listed below.

Apart form this there are also two types of catalysis that are,

Positive CatalysisZeolites (Shape-Selective Catalysis)
Zeolites are aluminosilicates of the general formula, Mn[AlO2]x.(SiO2)y.mH2O, where, M may be a simple cation like Na, K or Ca, n is the charge on the simple cation, m is the number of molecules of water of crystallization.

They have a ? cage, which looks like a honeycomb. The shape and size of the reactant and product molecules influence the processes catalyzed by zeolites. This is why these reactions are referred to as shape-selective catalysis.

Zeolite
In the petrochemical industry, zeolites are commonly utilized as catalysts for the cracking and isomerization of hydrocarbons. The ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is a widely used zeolite catalyst in the petroleum sector (zeolite sieve of molecular porosity 5). It transforms alcohols straight to gasoline by dehydrating them first, resulting in a mixture of hydrocarbons. In the softening of hard water, hydrated zeolites are used as ‘ion-exchangers.’

Characteristics of Catalysis
Various properties/characterstics of the catalyst are added below,

At the end of the reaction, the mass and chemical makeup of a catalyst remains unchanged.
The reaction cannot be started by the catalyst.
In most cases, the catalyst is quite specific.
The catalyst has no ability to alter the state of equilibrium.
Changes in temperature affect the pace of catalytic reactions, just as they do in the absence of a catalyst.
Features of Solid Catalysis
Various features of the solid catalysis of any chemical reaction are,

Catalyst Activity

Catalyst activity refers to how quickly they may speed up chemical reactions. In some reactions, the rate of acceleration can reach 1010 times. In the presence of platinum as a catalyst, the reaction between H2 and O2 to generate H2O, for example, occurs with explosive violence. H2 and O2 can be held indefinitely without undergoing any reactions in the absence of a catalyst.

Catalyst Selectivity

It is possible for catalysts to direct reactions to produce certain products (excluding others).

Theories of Catalysis
Various theories are present that explain the working of the catalyst and some of them are,

Collision Theory of Homogeneous Catalysis
Adsorption Theory of Heterogeneous Catalysis
Collision Theory of Homogeneous Catalysis
According to the Collision Theory, A reaction happens as a result of effective collisions between the reacting molecules The molecules must have a minimum level of energy known as activation energy (Ea) in order to collide effectively. Following the collision, the molecules form an activated complex, which then dissociates to reveal the product molecules. The catalyst creates a novel pathway that requires less activation energy.

Adsorption Theory of Heterogeneous Catalysis
Adsorption of reactants on the surface of the catalyst is usually how heterogeneous catalytic reactions work. The diffusion theory of catalysis can be used to describe the mechanism of such surface reactions


                                                                          ",0,1,0,0,0
17,Acceleration,"Acceleration due to gravity (or acceleration of gravity) or gravity acceleration is the acceleration caused by the gravitational force of attraction of large bodies. As we know that the term acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to a given time. Scientists like Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Henry Cavendish soon discovered that this increase in speed, or acceleration, was caused by a different force known as gravity by studying objects falling to the Earth in a variety of circumstances.What is Acceleration due to Gravity?
Acceleration due to Gravity is defined as the acceleration attained by an object due to the gravitational force of attraction. When a body is fallen toward the earth it experiences a change in its acceleration due to the gravitational pull (or force) of the Earth. This acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity. This is the acceleration that is attained by an object due to gravitational force. 

The acceleration that an object experiences as a result of the gravitational force is known as acceleration due to gravity, ms-2 is its SI unit. It has a direction and a magnitude so it is a vector quantity as a result.

The symbol g represents the acceleration due by gravity. Its typical value at sea level on the surface of the earth is 9.8 ms-2. The second law of motion and the law of universal gravitation of Newton serve as the foundation for its calculation.

Acceleration due to Gravity Formula
Mathematically, the acceleration due to gravity is directly proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the distance from the center of mass, so given as:

g

where, 



g is the acceleration due to gravity,
G is the Gravitational constant, 
m is the mass of the body and 
r is the distance from the center.
Units of Acceleration due to Gravity
The SI unit of Acceleration due to Gravity is m/s2.
The CGS unit of g is cm/s2.
And the dimensional formula of Acceleration due to Gravity is [ML0T-2].
Derivation for the formula of acceleration due to gravity
According to the second law of motion:



F = ma



But, in case of a free-falling body, the force is equal to the product of the mass of the body and acceleration due to gravity.



F = mg        ……(1)



But, according to the universal law of gravitation:

18,Measurements,"Measurement is a technique that is required to measure and quantify various parameters of an object. Measurement is the essential metric to express any quantity of objects, things, and events that help us to compare that object with other similar objects. In our daily lives, we use measurement in various ways such are weighing vegetables at the mandi, measuring milk and petrol, etc.Measurement Definition
Measurement is the process of assigning a numerical value to a physical quantity or attribute of an object or phenomenon. Measurement helps us to compare, describe, and understand the world around us. For example, we can measure the length of a pencil, the mass of an apple, or the time it takes to run a race.

Measurement Unit Table
To measure different quantities, we need to use different units of measurement. A unit of measurement is a standardized quantity that can be used to express the magnitude of a physical quantity. For example, a meter is a unit of length, a kilogram is a unit of mass and a second is a unit of time.

There are different systems of units, such as the International System of Units (SI), the British Imperial System, and the US Customary System. The SI system is the most widely used and accepted system of units in the world. It consists of seven base units and several derived units. The table below shows some of the common units of measurement in the SI system and their symbols.

Measurement Conversion
Sometimes, we need to convert between different units of measurement to compare or calculate different quantities. For example, we may need to convert from metres to centimetres or from kilograms to pounds. To do this, we need to use conversion factors, which are ratios that relate one unit to another. For example, the conversion factor from metres to centimetres is 100, because 1 metre is equal to 100 centimetres. Similarly, the conversion factor from kilograms to pounds is 2.205, because 1 kilogram is equal to 2.205 pounds. To convert from one unit to another, we need to multiply or divide by the appropriate conversion factor.

For example, to convert 5 metres to centimetres, we need to multiply by 100:


5 m × 100 = 500 cm


To convert 3 kilograms to pounds, we need to multiply by 2.205:


3 kg × 2.205 = 6.615 lb


To convert 10 seconds to milliseconds, we need to multiply by 1000:


10 s × 1000 = 10000 ms
To convert 25 degrees Celsius to kelvin, we need to add 273.15:


25 °C + 273.15 = 298.15 K
Measurement of Length
Length is the measure of how long or how far something is. The SI unit of length is the metre, which is defined as the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a second. Some other common units of length are the kilometre (km), the centimetre (cm), the millimetre (mm), the micrometre (µm) and the nanometre (nm).

20,Force,"Force is defined as an external cause that a body experiences as a result of interacting with another body. Whenever two objects interact, a force is exerted on each object. What is Force?
A push and pull of an object are referred to as a force in science. Force is created when two things interact. The force is a vector quantity as it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of a force is represent its strength. The force can also cause a change in direction of the body to which the force is applied.

Any external element that has a tendency to change the state of motion or rest, when applied to an object is called force. Force is simply the push or pull upon an object resulting to the interaction between the two objects.



A force can cause an item to move from rest to motion or vice versa. Two or more things must interact with each other for a force to be created. For example, a force is applied by the wind when it propels a sailboat through the water, A force is also present when gravity pulls an apple downward. Things can move, change their speed, or change shape in response to forces. 

Force Definition
Unit of Force
Force is a vector quantity, this implies it has both mass and magnitude. The force acting on an object is represented by the symbol F or 
F
?
   
F
  .
The SI unit of force is Newton (N). It is named after the famous English scientist Sir Issac Newton. 1-Newton force is defined as the force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kg by 1 m/s2 in the direction of applied force.
In the CGS system, the unit of force is Dyne.
Dimensions Of Force
Force is defined as the product of the mass and acceleration of the body. So its dimensional formula is, [MLT-2].

Effects of Forces
Following are the effects of force with examples:

Force can change the shape and size of an object. Example: In clay modelling, force of hands is utilized to change the shape and size of the clay.
Force can change the direction of an object. Example: A cricketer hits the ball in the desired direction coming towards himself/herself
Force can change the speed of an object. Example: The frictional force of brakes is used to stop or de-accelerating a moving vehicle.
Force can change the state of rest or motion of an object. Example: A football at rest moves when kicked.Let’s understand the effects of force and its example

Force can change the shape and size of an object
Force can cause a change in shape. For example when hammering a hot iron rod, the force exerted by the hammer will change the object’s shape, i.e. iron rod will be bent.

Force can cause a change in size. For example: By stretching a rubber band, the force exerted by stretching a rubber band will cause an increase in the size of the rubber band.

Force can change the direction of an object
Force can cause a change in direction. For example: The time you kick the football, its direction get changed.

Force can change the speed of an object
When a batsman in games like cricket and baseball hit the moving ball with force, It causes an increase in the speed of the ball. Also, the speed of force will depend on the direction in which it is applied. If we apply a force in the direction of a moving object then it will cause an increase in speed and when it is applied against the moving object then it will decrease the speed of the object.

Force can change the state of rest or motion of an object
Force will cause a change in motion, for example, the force exerted by the motor of the car will enable the car to move, while force exerted by the brake will enable the car to stop.

Force Formulas
Force is defined by the product of the mass and acceleration of the object. For a body with mass “m” and the acceleration “a” the force can be calculated as,

F = ma



where, 



F is the applied force,
m is the mass of an object and 
a is the acceleration of the object.



Also according to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, force is given by the time rate of change of momentum. Mathematically, it is given as,

?Magnitude and Direction of Force
To move a large weight, the individual must pull or push it in the same direction. When two individuals push or pull weight in opposite directions, the resultant force is the sum of the two forces. The magnitude of a force expresses its strength. When forces are applied in the opposite direction, the size of the resultant force is reduced.

Furthermore, equal and opposing forces cancel out, thus the resulting force is zero. Force exerted on an item causes a change in velocity as well as a change in shape. Some forces operate on an item by making touch with it, whilst others act without making contact with the object. Touch forces are forces that act when an item comes into contact with them.

Contact forces include muscular forces and friction forces. Non-contact forces are those that may act without coming into touch with an item. Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, electrostatic force, and non-contact forces are all examples of forces

Types of Force
A Force can act on an object with or without any contact. For example, if you are pushing or pulling a door then you must have contact with a door while if you have a bar magnet you can easily attract iron nails without having any contact with the nail. So in science, we have two types of forces, one is a contact force and the other is a non-contact force. Contact Force
The forces which are applied to other objects only through physical touching are called contact forces. 



Contact Force
Examples of contact forces are muscular and frictional forces.Muscular Force
Muscular force is a contact force in which force is exerted by the muscles of the body. For example, jumping, kicking, running, walking, climbing, lifting, and pushing all are the forces exerted by our muscles.

Force of Friction
Frictional Force is a contact force that always opposes the body’s state of motion over another body. For example, if we stop paddling a bicycle, gradually it gets slows down and stops after covering some distance.

Non-Contact Force
The forces which are applied to other objects without any physical touching are called non-contact forces. 



Examples of non-contact forces are magnetic force, electrostatic force, and gravitational force. Now let’s discuss types of non-contact force in detail.

Non-Contact Force
Magnetic Force
Magnetic force is a non-contact force exerted by a magnet on any other magnetic substance. For example, if we bring a magnet near an iron nail then the magnet pulls them towards it since magnets exert force.

Electrostatic Force
An electrostatic force is a non-contact force that can be exerted by a charged object on another object from a distance. For example, when a plastic comb is rubbed in dry hair, then the electrically charged comb attracts a tiny piece of papers

Gravitational Force
The Gravitational force is a non-contact force between two bodies having some mass. It is an attractive force. The force of attraction between the earth and any object is called the force of gravity.

Learn more, Gravitational Force

Line of Action of a Force
Galileo used experiments to demonstrate that when there is no external force acting on an object, it moves at a constant speed. He could observe that a sphere’s speed rises as it rolls down an inclined plane because of its gravitational attraction on it.The net force acting on an object is 0 when all the forces are equal and balanced. A net force acting on a body, however, can change either the magnitude or the direction of its velocity if all of the forces acting on it result in an unbalanced force, which indicates that the unbalanced force can accelerate the body. For instance, when a body is subjected to a number of forces and is determined to be at rest, we can infer that there is zero net force operating on the body.

The line of action of a force is the path it takes as it exerts its force on an object. The point of application of the force is the location where it is exerting its force on an object. The force of friction is the force that opposes the relative motion between the surfaces of two objects in contact and acts along the surfaces.Solved Examples on Force
Example 1: Determine the force of an object with a mass equal to 500 kg and acceleration as 60 m/s2.

21,cell,"The cell is the fundamental and structural unit of all forms of life. Every cell is made up of cytoplasm that is enclosed in a membrane and includes many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites as well as many macromolecules including proteins, DNA, and RNA. The term “cell” is derived from the Latin word cellula, which means “small room.”Cell Definition

Cell is the smallest, fundamental unit of life and is responsible for all life’s functions. It is the basic biological, structural, and functional components of all living things.


What is Cell in Biology?
A cell is the basic unit of life. The cell is the lowest level of organization of any living organism. It was first discovered by Robert Hooke. The study of cells is known as cell biology. The organisms can be classified into two types on the basis of number of cells, i.e., unicellular and multicellular organisms. The size and shape of the cell are according to the function of that cell. The cell is a combination of different cell organelles which perform different functions.

Labeled Diagram of a Cell
The labeled diagram of plant and animal cell shown below:

Plant-Cell-and-Animal-Cell-Diagram

Discovery of Cell
Rober Hooke observed a cell for the first time in 1665. He was observing a dried piece of cork with a compound microscope. During the observation, he noticed various little chambers which he named the ‘cells’. Compound microscopes have limited magnification and cannot see the cell properly. Hence, with all his observations he stated that those chambers are non-living. After some time, another scientist Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed cork under a compound microscope with more magnification power. During his observation, he saw that cells were showing some movements. Hence, he stated that cells are living.

Magnification technology progressed enough to find cells, as microscopes experienced continuous improvement over time. Robert Hooke is usually acknowledged with making this discovery, which established cell biology as a field of study. He could see pores when looking through the microscope at a piece of cork. At the time, this was remarkable because it was thought that nobody else had seen these. Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann both investigated plant and animal cells to support their respective theories. They found that the two varieties of cells differed significantly from one another. This promoted the concept that cells were essential to both plants and animals.

Cell Theory
Cell theory was proposed by Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839). The cell theory postulates are given below:

All living things are composed of cells.
Cells serve as the fundamental building blocks for the growth of tissues and organs.
Cells can only develop from other cells, which is the third and possibly most important characteristic of the theory.
Every living being started with a single cell which split through the process of mitosis to generate multiple identical cells. These cells can specialize to create various tissues and organs. This method is used to create a complete complex organisms. A single-celled organism, on the other hand, splits when its cells separate into two different species. This method is known as asexual reproduction.

Types of Cells
There are 2 main types of cells – Eukaryotes and prokaryotes cells.

Characteristic	Prokaryotic Cell	Eukaryotic Cell
Development	Less developed	More developed
Nucleus	Absent	Present
Genetic Material	Nucleoid containing DNA or RNA	True nucleus containing DNA
Organelles	Absent	Membrane-bound organelles present
Size	0.1 to 0.5 mm	10-100 ?m
Reproduction	Binary fission, fragmentation, conjugation	Sexual and asexual reproduction
Examples	Bacteria, Archaea	Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protists
Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cell Diagram
Given below is the detailed well-labeled diagram of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell.

Prokaryotic-and-Eukaryotic-cell

Structure of Cell
The cell structure consists of various components and cell organelles with distinct functions. They are:

Cell Wall
Cell wall is a characteristic feature of plant cell. It comprises the outermost layer of the cell. Cell wall is made up of gelatin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. It protects the plasma membrane. It is a rigid and immovable structure enclosing the cell membrane. It protects the cells from mechanical shocks and damage while providing them form and support. Cell wall is absent in animal cells.

Cell Membrane
A cell membrane surrounds the cell. The cell membrane divides cells into the internal and external components of the cell. It protects a cell’s integrity and regulates the flow of materials into and out of the cell as it is semi-permeable. Two layers of phospholipid molecules form the cell membrane. The cell membrane proteins provides structural support, faciliate material transport, act as receptor sites for signaling molecules and transport substances across the membrane.

Cytoplasm
The gel-like substance that fills a cell is called cytoplasm. Cytoplasm functions as the site where various cellular processes occur, including metabolism, protein synthesis, and intracellular transport. It serves as a catalyst for chemical reactions. The cytoplasm of a cell performs every task necessary for cell division, growth, and replication. Diffusion moves materials within the cytoplasm.

Nucleus and Nucleolus
The nucleus is a crucial organelle found in eukaryotic cells, serving as the control center of the cell. It contains the genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. The nuclear membrane surrounding the cell acts as a barrier, separating the nucleus from other cell parts.Within the nucleus, the nucleolus stands out as a distinct region responsible for ribosome assembly. It synthesizes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and combines it with proteins to form ribosomes, essential for protein synthesis. Together, the nucleus and nucleolus play vital roles in controlling cellular activities, maintaining genetic integrity, and regulating gene expression.

Cell Organelles
Organelles are cell components that have been modified and/or specialized to perform one or more important functions. Cell organelles are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells; however, bacterial organelles are more basic and not membrane-bound. A cell contains different kinds of organelles. The cell organlles structure and function is given below:

Cell Organelles

Chromosomes

Thread-like structures made of DNA and protein

Carries genetic information

Endoplasmic Reticulum

Network of membranous tubules and sacs; rough ER has ribosomes attached, while smooth ER does not.

Involved in protein and lipid synthesis, as well as transportation of molecules within the cell.

Golgi Bodies

Stack of flattened membrane-bound sacs (cisternae) with associated vesicles

Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transportation or secretion.

Ribosomes

Made of RNA and protein; can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the ER.

Site of protein synthesis.

Mitochondria

Double membrane-bound organelle with inner cristae folds; contains mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

Generates ATP through cellular respiration; known as the “powerhouse” of the cell

Chloroplast

Double membrane-bound organelles with internal thylakoid membranes

Site of photosynthesis in plant cells; contains chlorophyll for capturing light energy.

Vacuoles

Membrane-bound sacs filled with fluid or sap; larger in plant cells.

Store water, nutrients, and waste; maintain turgor pressure in plant cells.

Lysosomes

Membrane-bound vesicles containing digestive enzymes.

contain digestive enzymes for breaking down waste materials and foreign invaders.

Characteristics of Cells
Below are the following characteristics of a cell.

Cells help in formation of the structure of an organism.
A cell is a membrane-bound organelle having other cell organelles which perform different functions.
Nucleus present in the between of a cell carries all the genetic information of a cell.
Lysosomes help in cellular digestion.
Cytoplasm is present in the interior of a cell in which all cell organelles are present.
Functions of a Cell
The below mentioned are some of the functions of a cell:

Structure and Support: Cells provide the structural basis of all organisms.
Growth: Cells are responsible for the growth of the organism.
Transport: Cells transport the nutrients that are used in the different chemical processes which take place inside them. As a result of these processes, a waste product is produced. Cells then work to get rid of this waste. In this manner, small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ethanol pass through the cell membrane by diffusion. This method is known as passive transport. On the other hand, the larger molecules like the proteins and polysaccharides, go in and out of the cell via active transport.
Energy Production: Organisms need energy to perform different chemical reactions. In plants, the energy comes from the process of photosynthesis while in animals the energy comes via respiration.
Metabolism: The cell is responsible for the metabolism which includes all the chemical reactions that take place inside an organism to keep it alive.
Reproduction: A cell helps in reproduction through the processes of mitosis and meiosis.
Conclusion – Cell Structure and Function
In conclusion, the cell is the basic unit of life, consisting of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and containing various cell organelles essential for life processes. Through cell theory, we explore the cell structure, functions, and types, understanding its significance in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Cells are classified into prokaryotic and eukaryotic, each with distinct characteristics and organelles, contributing to essential cellular functions like growth, transport, energy production, and reproduction. The different cell organelles play crucial roles in maintaining cellular integrity.

22,Units and measurement,"Units and Dimensions is a fundamental and essential topic in Physics. For the measurement of a physical quantity, Unit plays a vital role. Unit provides a complete idea about the measurement of a physical quantity. Dimension is a measure of the size or extent of a particular quantity.In this article, we will learn Units and Dimensions related all details including definition, fundamental and derived units, system of units, List of Units of physical quantities, Dimension formula, List of physical quantities and their dimensions, etc.
What are Units? Units are values used to measure and express various physical quantities. Unit gives us a complete and clear idea about a physical quantity. Measurement of a physical quantity consists of mainly two parts – Numeric value and unit.Measurement of physical quantity = Numerical value x Unit .
Fundamental and Derived Units
Fundamental Units are independent to each other and these units are mainly used to measure the units of the fundamental physical quantities. There are seven fundamental units available namely – meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole.Derived Units are the units which are obtained from the fundamental units. Except fundamental units, all other units are known as Derived Units. The examples of Derived units are units of area, volume, momentum, speed, velocity, density, force, energy, work etc.System of Units
There are four system of units available namely – MKS System, CGS System, FPS System, and SI system.

MKS System: The full form of MKS System is Metre Kilogram Second. In MKS system, the units of length, mass and time are respectively metre, kilogram and second.

CGS System : The full form of CGS system is Centimetre Gram Second. CGS system is also known as Gaussian system. In CGS system, the units of length, mass and time are respectively centimetre, gram and second.

SI System : SI system is generally known as International System of Units. It is the modification form of MKS system. SI System of unit is adopted to have same common unit world-wide.What are Dimensions?
Dimensions of a physical quantity are defined as the powers to which the fundamental quantities should be raised to represent that physical quantity. Dimension of a physical quantity is not dependent on the magnitude or the numeric value of that physical quantity.

To represent dimensions of physical quantities, we use square bracket “[ ]” around the quantity.

Dimensional Formula
Dimensional formula is nothing but an expression that shows how the fundamental units and which of the fundamental units are required to represent the unit of physical quantity.

The process of writing of a dimensional formula of a physical quantity is by enclosing the symbols of the base quantities with appropriate power in square brackets.

Dimensions of fundamental physical quantities along with their dimensional symbols are written as –

[M] for Mass
[L] for Length
[T] for Time
[I] for Electric Current
[?] for Temperature
[J] for Luminous intensity
[N] for Amount of substanceQuantities Having the Same Dimensional Formula
The following physical quantities have the same Dimensional formula:

Planck’s constant, Angular momentum, rotational impulse
Pressure, Stress, modulus of elasticity, energy density.
Force constant, surface tension, surface energy.
Frequency, Angular velocity, velocity gradient.
Gravitational potential, latent heat.
Entropy, Thermal capacity, universal gas constant and Boltzmann’s constant.
Force, thrust.
Power, luminous flux.
Dimensionless Quantities
Dimensionless quantities are the physical quantities which have no dimension or zero dimension. Its numeric value or magnitude is same in all system of units.

Examples : The examples of dimensionless quantities are as follows:

Angle
Solid angle
Relative density

Uses of Dimension
Dimension of a physical quantity is an essential part. It has following uses –

It is used to convert the units from one measurement system to another measurement system.
It helps to establish relationship among various physical quantities.
It is used to ensure an equation is homogeneous or not.

23,motion in a Straight Line,"What is Motion?The change in the position of anybody with respect to time can be termed motion. Any object under motion can be visualized by the naked eye by determining the change in the positional coordinates and then, associating it through the eye of the arbitrary observer. Motion can be computed in terms of both the position vectors, that is, the displacement, and distance, and taking into consideration the speed factors, that is, velocity, acceleration, speed, and time.  How to Identify an Object in Motion?
Any movement done by the object can be found by comparing the new position and the original position of the object. The change in the position of the object, with respect to time, is considered motion. Several things around us move like Earth which appears to be still but is always in motion. The car, bikes, people, and other things around us also move.Parameters in Motion
There are four main parameters that affect the motion of the objects they are:

Distance (d)
Displacement (s)
Speed/Velocity (v)
Time (t)Distance
Distance is used to refer to the complete path length between any two successive points. The distance is a scalar quantity, with only magnitude and no associated direction. Therefore, the distance is always positive in nature. The distance of a body gives the descriptive route information being followed by an object from one point to another. Since the distance between two points is equivalent to the path length, it can be measured across different trajectories, that is, linear or zigzag paths. The distance is denoted by the symbol ‘d’. 
Distance = Speed × Time
Displacement
Displacement is the direct length of the minimum path between any two successive points. Displacement, therefore, may refer to displacement as a vector quantity, with both an associated magnitude and direction. The displacement of an object between any two points is considered to be positive, negative, and even zero. Displacement is independent of the path and only depends upon the initial and final position of the body. Therefore, it does not provide complete information on the route. Displacement is always indicated with an arrow.  It is denoted by ‘s’. 
Displacement = Velocity × Time
Speed
Speed can be defined as the rate of change of position of an object moving in any direction. Speed is measured as the ratio of the distance covered by an object to the total time to cover this distance. The speed of a body is considered to be a scalar quantity, with only magnitude and no associated direction.Speed = Distance / TimeVelocity
Velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement per unit time. It is a vector quantity. Velocity is nothing but speed in a particular direction. Hence, the unit and dimension formula of velocity is same as that of speed. Hence, the unit of velocity is m/s and the dimensional formula is LT-1
Time   Time is an important frame of reference to evaluate the change in state and motion of the objects. Time is referred to as the interval over which any object undergoes modifications in its motion, orientation and structure. The criteria for evaluation that time has passed is the modification in any object.

S.I. unit for time is the second, abbreviated as s. It is also measured in other units such as minutes(m), hours(hr), etc. The dimensional formula for time is [T1].
Types of Motion.  The motion of an object depends on the force acting on the body. There are various kinds of motion and different kinds of motion are explained below in this article,

Linear Motion
Translational Motion
Rotational Motion
Periodic Motion
Simple Harmonic Motion
Oscillatory Motion
Projectille Motion Linear Motion
Linear motion is a specific type of translational motion where the body moves only in one single direction. It can be either in the x-direction or in the y-direction or in the z-direction.

For example the motion of ants on the edge of the knife and others.

Translational Motion
In Translational motion, the object is free to move and can move in any of the three (x, y, z) directions. For example, the motion of Areoplane, birds, bees, etc is considered to be translational motion.

Rotational Motion
In Rotational motion, the object moves along a circular path about a fixed axis. For example, the Rotational motion of the Earth, Moon, Top and others is the form of the Rotational Motion.

Periodic Motion
Periodic motion is the type of motion that repeats itself after certain intervals of time. For example, the motion of the Earth around the Sun, the motion of the comments, and the motion of the Moon around the Earth exhibit periodic motion. Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple Harmonic Motion is a specific type of periodic motion in which the particle moves to and fro around a fixed point. Like in the case of a simple pendulum.

Oscillatory Motion
The to-and-fro motion of an object is called the Oscillatory Motion it is repetitive in nature it repeats itself within a fixed time frame. Mechanical oscillations are called vibrations. For example the motion of the guitar strings and other.

Projectile Motion
When an object has both horizontal displacement as well as vertical displacement then it is said to be in Projectile motion. For example, the movement of the bullet fired from the gun, and a stone thrown in the air also follows the projectile motion. Types of Motion as per State of Motion There are two types of Motion on the basis of State of Motion

Uniform Motion
Non-Uniform Motion
Now let’s learn about them in detail.

Uniform Motion
The uni-dimensional motion of an object where it travels with uniform speed all along the path is called Uniform motion. Since the body covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, the velocity of the body remains constant. The speed of an object remains the same during all time frames, the average speed of the object is equivalent to its actual speed. No acceleration is attained by the object in the case of uniform motion. For instance, a car travelling 20 km in the first hour, 20 km in the next hour, and so on continue with this throughout its motion. Examples of Uniform Motion
Various examples of the objects performing the uniform motion are,

The hands of the clock cover equal distances.
A car going along a straight level road at a steady speed.
An aeroplane flying at a steady speed in the air.
Non-Uniform Motion
The uni-dimensional motion of an object where it travels with a varying speed all along the path is called Non-Uniform motion. Since the body covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time, the velocity of the body remains modified. The speed of an object changes during the time frames, and the average speed may be different from its actual speed. Acceleration or deceleration is attained by the object in the case of non-uniform motion. For instance, a car travelling 20 km in the first hour, 30 km in the next hour, and so on. Continuing with a varying speed throughout its motion.

Examples of Non-Uniform Motion
Various examples of the objects performing the non-uniform motion are,

A racing car
A ball bouncing at different intervals
Two cars colliding with each other .Types of Motion as Per Directions
There are three types of motion in physics as per the direction of motion that are,

One Dimensional Motion
Two Dimensional Motion
Three Dimensional Motion
Now let’s learn about them in detail.

One Dimensional Motion
Whenever anyone out of the three coordinate spaces representing the position of the object undergoes any change (shape, speed, distance) with respect to time, then that motion is called one-dimensional motion, or uni-dimensional motion.

Examples of One Dimensional Motion
Examples of One Dimensional Motion are,

The motion of a steel block in a straight line,
Object freely falling under the effect of gravity.
A man walking through a straight lane. Two Dimensional Motion
Whenever any pair out of the three coordinate spaces representing the position of the object undergoes any change (shape, speed, distance) with respect to time, then that motion is called two-dimensional motion, or bi-dimensional motion.

Examples of Two Dimensional Motion
Examples of Two Dimensional Motion are,

Movement of a train along a zigzag track.
The rotation of the planets around the sun. Three Dimensional Motion
Whenever all the three coordinate spaces representing the position of the object undergoes any change (shape, speed, distance) with respect to time, then that motion is called three-dimensional motion. The body tends to undergo movement within a planar structure.

Examples of Three Dimensional Motion
Examples of Three Dimensional Motion are,

Objects flying in arbitrary paths in the sky.
The motion of atoms inside a gas molecule.
Laws of Motion
Laws of motion also known as Newton’s Laws of Motion are the basic laws that help us to understand the motion of any object. These laws are valid for each inertial frame of reference. The three laws of motion are:

First Law of Motion: Also known as Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object stays in an existing state of motion or rest unit unless a net external force is applied to it.

Second Law of Motion: Also known as Newton’s Second Law of Motion states that the change in momentum of the object with respect to time is equal to the net force applied.

Third Law Motion: Also known as Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Equations of Motion
There are three equations of motion. These are mentioned below:

First Equation of Motion: It is used to find the final velocity of an object if its initial velocity, acceleration and time is given. Mathematically it is represented as v = u + at

Second Equation of Motion: It is used to find the distance if the initial velocity, acceleration and time is given. Mathematically it is given as s = ut + 1/2at2

Third Equation of Motion: In this equation, the difference of squares of final and initial velocity is equal to twice the product of acceleration and distance. Mathematically it is given as v2 – u2 = 2as",1,0,0,0,0
24,Motion in a Plane,"Motion in Two Dimension . A particle moving in a plane can be described by using the coordinates. But often this information is not enough to fully describe the state and the behavior of the particle. There are still some questions left unanswered. For example, how fast is it moving? In which direction and what is the acceleration and direction of acceleration of the particle? These parameters are necessary to describe the motion of the particle in a 2D plane. Fortunately, all of this can be figured out using a bit of vector algebra and calculus. Let’s see how to do that in detail. Motion in a Plane. Suppose a particle is moving from a point X on the Cartesian plane to a point Y. Position vectors are necessary to describe the current position of the particle. These vectors are always with respect to the reference frame at the origin. The following parameters are required to fully describe the behavior of a particle moving in a plane,

Position
Velocity
Acceleration. Position Vector

The vector which denotes the position and direction of the particle’s position with respect to the origin is called the position vector. Velocity

The velocity of a particle can be described in two ways – average velocity and instantaneous velocity. When the particle is under acceleration, it changes its velocity every second. So, a single value cannot be assigned to a velocity. In such cases, the instantaneous velocity is preferred, which describes the velocity and its direction at a particular instant. Acceleration

The acceleration of a body moving in a plane is given by the rate of change in its velocity. Similar to velocity, there can be two cases here too – average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration. Average acceleration is given by the ratio of the net change in the velocity of the object with the total time taken.",1,0,0,0,0
25,laws of motion work  energy and power,"Work Energy Theorem  .The concept “work” is commonly used in ordinary speech, and we understand that it refers to the act of accomplishing something. For example, you are currently improving your understanding of Physics by reading this article! However, Physics may disagree on this point. The Work-energy Theorem explains why this Physics of no work exists!

When an operating force displaces a particle, work is said to be done. There is no work done if there is no relocation. You may become fatigued if you stand for an extended period of time, but according to Physics, you have done no labor.  What is Work?


The work done on a system by a constant force is the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts. 
Work done in one-dimensional motion can be expressed in equation form as

W = Fdcos?  . where W is work, F is the magnitude of the force of the system, d the magnitude of the displacement of the system, and ? is the angle between the force vector F and the displacement vector d.

Work Done can be either Positive or Negative or even Zero.

Positive Work: When a force moves an object in its direction, the work done is considered positive. Example: The motion of a ball falling towards the earth, where the displacement of the ball is measured, is an example of this type of work. The ball is moving in the direction of gravity.
Negative Work: When force and displacement are in opposite directions, it is presumed that the work is negative. Example: When a ball is tossed upwards, for example, the displacement will be upwards; nevertheless, the force due to friction will be downwards. The earth’s gravity will be in a downward direction.
Zero Work: The total work done by the force on the object is zero if the direction of the force and the displacement are perpendicular to each other. Example: When we push forcefully against a wall, for example, the force we are exerting on the wall is ineffective since the wall’s displacement equals d = 0.   
 What is Energy? .   The capacity to work is defined as energy. Some types of energy include potential energy, kinetic energy, thermal energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, and nuclear energy. Motion is linked to all sources of energy. When a body is in motion, for example, it has kinetic energy. When a tensed object, such as a bow or spring, is at rest, it has the capacity to create motion; its configuration holds potential energy. Nuclear energy is also potential energy because it arises from the arrangement of subatomic particles in an atom’s nucleus.  There are many forms of energy as mentioned above, Here we mainly focus on Kinetic energy. 

Kinetic Energy:

Kinetic energy is the type of energy that an object or particle has as a result of its movement.
When work is done on an object by exerting a net force, the item accelerates and gains kinetic energy as a result.
Kinetic energy is a property of a moving object or particle that is determined by its mass as well as its motion.
If the motion along a path from one place to another, the kind of kinetic energy that the object possesses is Translational Kinetic Energy, if rotation about an axis, then the object possesses Rotational Kinetic Energy.   Translational Kinetic Energy: 
A body’s translational kinetic energy is equal to half of the product of its mass, m, and its velocity, v, or frac{1}/{2} *mv^2
This formula is only valid for particles moving at low to moderate speeds; for really high-speed particles, it produces values that are too small. When an object approaches the speed of light (3 × 108 meters per second, or 186,000 miles per second), its mass increases, requiring the application of the rules of relativity.
The increase in mass of a particle over its rest mass multiplied by the square of the speed of light equals relativistic kinetic energy.  Rotational Kinetic Energy: The moment of inertia I, for a rotating body, relates to mass, while the angular velocity (omega), relates to linear, or translational velocity. As a result, rotational kinetic energy equals half of the product of moment of inertia and square of angular velocity or {1}/{2} *I^2.                         Work-Energy Theorem
The statement of the Work energy theorem is,  Work-energy theorem states that the work done by the sum of all forces acting on a particle equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle (or) The net work done on a system is equal to the change in Kinetic energy.
The work W done by the net force on a particle equals the change in the particle’s kinetic energy KE.  W= \frac{1}{2}mv_f-\frac{1}{2}mv_i  .where vi and vf are the speeds of the particle before and after the application of force, and m is the particle’s mass. 
  Power .  Power in Physics is defined as the time rate of the amount of energy converted or transferred. In the SI system (or International System of Units), Watt (W) is the unit of Power. Watt is equal to one joule per second. In earlier studies, power is sometimes called Activity. Power is a scalar quantity. Power is a function of Work done, therefore if a person works at a variable rate depending on the time of day, his power will likewise vary. Power Formulas 
Power is defined as the time rate of work done by the object, then, mathematically this can be given by the power formula:Power Formulas 
P = W ? t .where,
W is the Work done,
t is the Time for which work is done, and
P is the Power gain or loss.
Hence, the above relation of Power is called the work-time equation .  Work done (W) by an object can be defined as the product of force and the displacement of the object, then the power formula in terms of force is given by- Since, W = F × s  . Therefore,P = (F × s) ? t .  where,
F is the force required,
s is the displacement of the object,
t is the time taken.
Units of Power
The SI unit of Power is Watt (W) whose multiples are, KW, MW, GW, and Others.A Watt is defined as, when a body does work of one joule in one second it is called One-Watt Power.
1 Watt (W) = 1 Joule (J) / 1 Second (s)
Another unit of power is Horsepower (hp), where 1 hp = 746 W
Dimensional Formula for Power is [ML2T-3]",1,0,0,0,0
26,Systems of particles and rotational motion,"Concepts of Rotational Motion . Rotational motion refers to the movement of an object around a fixed axis. It is a complex concept that requires an understanding of several related concepts. Some of the important concepts related to rotational motion include angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, torque, the moment of inertia, centripetal force, kinetic energy, angular momentum, and the conservation of angular momentum.A system of particles is a collection of several individual particles that are interacting with each other. In physics, the behaviour of such a system is studied to understand the interactions between the individual particles and the resulting motion of the entire system.What is Rotational Motion?
Rotational motion is the motion of an object around a fixed axis of rotation. It is a type of motion that occurs when an object is rotating about a point, rather than moving in a straight line.

In rotational motion, an object is characterized by its angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. The angular position of an object is its orientation with respect to a reference point and is measured in radians. The angular velocity of an object is its rate of change of angular position and is measured in radians per second. The angular acceleration of an object is its rate of change of angular velocity and is measured in radians per second squared.  Angular Displacement
Angular displacement is the change in an object’s orientation with regard to its initial position, measured in radians. It is a vector quantity that describes the size and direction of the orientation change.                            Angular Velocity
Angular velocity is the rate at which an object rotates, expressed in radians per second. It is a vector quantity describing the amplitude and direction of rotational motion.   Angular Acceleration
Angular acceleration is the rate at which angular velocity changes, expressed in radians per second squared. It is a scalar quantity that describes the rate at which rotational velocity changes.

Torque is a force that induces rotation and is equal to the product of the applied force and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the force’s line of action. Torque can be used to explain an object’s rotational motion since the net torque exerted on it is proportional to its angular acceleration.Moment of Inertia
An object’s moment of inertia is a measure of its resistance to rotational motion that depends on its mass distribution and the distance of each particle from the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia can be used to characterize an object’s rotational motion since the net torque acting on an item is proportional to its angular acceleration, which is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia.  Kinetic Energy of Rotation
The kinetic energy of rotation is the energy that an object has as a result of its rotational motion, which is equal to one-half the product of its moment of inertia and angular velocity squared. This energy can be used to describe an object’s rotational motion, as an object with a high angular velocity and a big moment of inertia will have a high kinetic energy of rotation. Formulas used in Rotational Motion
Several formulas are used in the study of systems of particles and rotational motion. Some of the most important formulas are, Center of Mass  .The formula for the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by,  Rcm = (m1r1 + m2r2 + … + mnrn) / (m1 + m2 + … + mn)


where,
Rcm is the position vector of the centre of mass, 
m1, m2, …, mn are the masses of the particles,
r1, r2, …, rn are the position vectors of the particles.               Linear Momentum
The formula for the linear momentum of a system of particles is given,P = m1v1 + m2v2 + … + mnvn 


where, 
P is the linear momentum of the system, 
m1, m2, …, mn are the masses of the particles,
v1, v2, …, vn are the velocity vectors of the particles.            Linear Kinetic Energy    The formula for the linear kinetic energy of a system of particles is given,


T = (1/2)m1v12 + (1/2)m2v22 + … + (1/2)mnvn2


where
T is the linear kinetic energy of the system, 
m1, m2, …, mn are the masses of the particles,
v1, v2, …, vn are the velocity vectors of the particles.
Torque
The formula for the torque on a particle is given,


? = r x F


where 
? is the torque, 
r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the axis of rotation,
F is the force applied to the particle.


Angular Momentum
The formula for the angular momentum of a system of particles is given,


L = I?


where,
L is the angular momentum of the system, 
I is the moment of inertia of the system,
? is the angular velocity of the system.


Angular Kinetic Energy
The formula for the angular kinetic energy of a system of particles is given,


K = (1/2)I?2 


where 
K is the angular kinetic energy of the system, 
I is the moment of inertia of the system,
? is the angular velocity of the system.                                                                          Motion of a Rigid Body.         A rigid body is a solid body that has little to no deformation when a force is applied. When forces are applied to such bodies, they come to translational and rotational motion. These forces change the momentum of the system. Rigid bodies are found almost everywhere in real life, all the objects found in real life are rigid in nature. It becomes essential to study the motion and the effects different forces have on them to be able to predict their trajectories. These kinds of predictions are used while making video games, robots, and spacecraft. Let’s see these concepts in detail.Rigid Body Dynamics
The concepts for rigid body dynamics were developed when classical mechanics was not able to solve motion and kinematic problems for bodies that did not point masses and were susceptible to rotation when forces were applied to them. A rigid body can have two types of motions when forces are applied to it: 

Translatory Motion.
Rotational Motion.
Translational Motion 

A body is said to be in translatory motion when all the particles on that body are moving the same distance in equal time intervals. This motion can be rectilinear or curvilinear. Some examples of translational motion include – a car moving in a straight line, a box sliding down a wedge. This kind of motion of governed by the equations of motion and Newton’s laws. 

Let F1, F2, F3, … Fn be the vector forces that are acting on the body. These forces cause acceleration in the direction where their resultant lies. This motion is governed by Newton’s Law.  \vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}
? \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + ... \vec{F}_n = m\vec{a}  .                         Rotational Motion 

A body is said to be in rotational motion when all the particles constituting the body are moving around a common rotational axis in the same direction. It is a type of circular motion. The examples for rotational motions include – tires of a car moving on the road, a ball rolling down a wedge, etc. Similar to translational motion, this motion can also be described by extending the laws and equations used in translation motion. 

Let \tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3, ... \tau_n be the torques that are acting on the body. These torques cause angular acceleration in the direction where their resultant lies. 

\vec{\tau}_{net} = I\vec{\alpha}

? \vec{\tau}_1 + \vec{\tau}_2 + ... \vec{\tau}_n = I\vec{\alpha} .                 What is Centre of Mass?
The center of mass (COM) is a theoretical point within an object or system of objects where the entire mass of the object or system can be considered to be concentrated. It is a point that represents the average position of all the mass in the object or system, taking into account both the distribution of mass and its spatial arrangement.

Centre of Mass Definition
The point at which the whole mass of the body seems to be concentrated is called Centre of Mass. It means the point from which we can support the object from below. 
Centre of Mass Formula
Now, it is clear that bodies that are uniform and symmetrical have their Centre of masses at their centroid. But for bodies that are not symmetrical and uniform, the answer is not that simple. The Centre of mass for such bodies can be anywhere. To work out the Centre of mass of a complex object. A weighted average of the locations of each mass of the body is taken. 

Let’s say there is a body of mass M, consisting of a set of masses “mi“, each at position ri, then as the total mass seems to concentrate at the centre of mass of the body then:

Mrcm = m1r1 + m2r2 + ….+ mnrn  . Linear Momentum of a System of Particles.  The mass (m) and velocity (v) of an item are used to calculate linear momentum. It is more difficult to halt an item with more momentum. p = m v is the formula for linear momentum. Conservation of momentum refers to the fact that the overall quantity of momentum never changes. Let’s learn more about linear momentum and momentum conservation. Linear Momentum of System of Particles
We know that the particle’s linear momentum is:

p = m v

where p represents the particle’s momentum.

For a single particle, Newton’s second law is:

F = dP ? dt,

where F represents the particle’s force.

The total linear momentum of ‘n‘ particles is:

P = p1 + p2 + …. + pn

Each momentum is expressed as m1 v1 + m2 v2 +………..+mn vn.

The velocity of the centre of mass is expressed as:

V = ? mi vi ? M

M V = ? mi vi

So, when we compare these equations, we get:

P = M V


As a result, we may state that, a system of particles’ total linear momentum is equal to the product of the system’s total mass and the velocity of its Centre of mass.",1,0,0,0,0
27,Gravitation,"Gravitational Force. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is used to explain gravitational force. Gravitational Force is a type of Non-contact force, the gravitational force is a force in nature that is always attractive and conservative. Gravitational Force is defined as the force of attraction experienced by two or more objects in contact. Gravitational force is determined by the formula obtained from Newton’s Universal Law of Attraction, known as the Gravitational Force Formula. Our environment is surrounded by gravity. It determines how much we weigh and how far a basketball will bounce before hitting the ground when it is thrown. The force the Earth applies to you is equal to the gravitational force on Earth. The gravitational force is equal to your weight while you are at rest on or near the Earth’s surface. Also, the presence of a gravitational field is required in the heat transfer through natural convection. What is Gravitational Force?  Gravitational or gravity is a force that attracts any two bodies in the universe, whether they have equal masses or not. Newton’s Law of Gravitation asserts that all objects, including oneself, attract each other. The unit of gravitational force is Newtons, denoted as N.  
Newton’s Law of Gravitation  Newton’s Law of Gravitation or Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation (or Universal Laws of Gravitation) is the Law that leads to the further study of Gravitation and states that all the objects in the universe having any masses always attract each other with a force of attraction. This force of attraction is called the Gravitational Force (F) which is,

Directly proportional to the product of the masses (m1 and m2) of the two objects in contact with other, and 
Inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centres.
The expression or the relation for the above-stated law is given by the gravitational force formula, discussed below: Gravitational Force Formula  . The Law of Gravitation gives the Gravitational Force (F) between two bodies of masses (m1 and m2) at a distance r, apart from their centers, is given as:



F ? m1m2



F ? 1/r2.   Unit of Gravitational Force
SI unit of Gravitational Force is Newton (N). 
Dimensional Formula of Gravitational Force is [M1L1T-2].  Properties of Gravitational Force
Here are some important characteristic features of Gravitational Force,

Gravitational forces are always attractive and the weakest of all the fundamental forces.
It is a type of Non-Contact Force, as it does not require any physical contact or touch to be experienced by a system of objects.
Gravitational Force is a Long-range force and does not require any medium.
The Gravitational Force value at the surface of the Earth is constant.Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion .Kepler’s law of planetary motion is the basic law that is used to define the motion of planets around the stars. These laws work in parallel with Newton’s Law and Gravitation Law and are helpful in studying the motion of various planetary objects.

Kepeler’s law provides three basic laws which are,

Kepler’s First law (Law of Orbits)
Kepler’s Second law (Law of Areas)
Kepler’s Third law (Law of Periods)
These laws are provided by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, hence the name Kepeler’s Law. Let’s learn about these in detail in this article.Introduction to Kepler’s Law
The motion of an object is always relative with respect to other motions. Motions are divided into two categories based on the energy of the particle in motion:

Bounded Motion
Unbounded Motion
Bounded Motion

The particle possesses negative total energy (E < 0) in bounded motion and has two or more extreme points where the total energy is always equal to the particle’s potential energy, i.e. the particle’s kinetic energy becomes zero.

When the eccentricity 0 ? e < 1, E < 0 denotes that the body’s motion is bounded. The eccentricity of a circular orbit is zero, whereas the eccentricity of an elliptical orbit is one.

Unbounded Motion

The particle in unbounded motion has positive total energy (E > 0) and a single extreme point where the total energy is always equal to the particle’s potential energy, i.e. the particle’s kinetic energy becomes zero.

When the eccentricity e ? 1, E > 0 denotes that the body is moving freely. The eccentricity of a parabolic orbit e = 1, while the eccentricity of a hyperbolic orbit e > 1.

Law of orbits, the law of equal areas, and the law of periods are Kepler’s first, second, and third laws described in detail below.Kepler’s First Law: The Law of Orbits
Kepler’s First Law known as the law of ellipses, states that planets revolve around the sun in an elliptical pattern. The law of orbits is a common name for Kepler’s first law . According to the rule, any planet’s orbit is an ellipse around the Sun, with the Sun at one of the ellipse’s two focal points.Kepler’s Second Law: The Law of Areas
Kepler’s Second Law, often known as the law of areas, determines the rate at which each planet will spin while circling the sun. The rate at which each planet rotates through space is continuously changing. When a planet is closest to the sun, it spins the quickest, and when it is furthest from the sun, it revolves the slowest.


According to Kepler’s second rule, when the orbiting satellite approaches the focus, it will accelerate. As the orbiting item comes closer to the object pushing it into the orbital path, the gravitational impact on it increases.
Law of Conservation of Momentum
This law can also be verified by the law of conservation of angular momentum which states that the momentum of a planet revolving around the star in a fixed orbit is always constant along the orbit.

Angular momentum of the planet at position B, LB = m rB vB.

Angular momentum of the planet at position D,  LD = m rD vD.

Now, since L is constant at any point, so LB = LD

rB vB = rD vD

The above expression shows that the distance and speed are inversely related to each other for a planet revolving in an orbit.

Area enclosed by a planet in an orbit is given by,


dA ? dt = L ? 2 m .where 
dA is the area enclosed by a planet
dt is the time taken to enclose the area
m is the mass of the planet
L is the angular momentum of the planet
Kepler’s Third Law: The Law of Periods
Kepler’s Third Law, often known as the law of periods, establishes a comparison of a planet’s orbital period and radius of orbit to those of other planets. The 3rd law compares the motion characteristics of various planets, as opposed to Kepler’s 1st and 2nd laws, which describe the motion property of a single planet.

Kepler’s third law defines the relationship between the mass of the planet star system, the distance of planets from the star, and their orbital period. It states that the square of the time period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit of the planet and inversely proportional to the sum of the mass of the star and planet.
The formula for Kepler’s third law is stated as:
T2 ?  a3


T2 = (4 ?2 a3) ? [G (M + m)]


where 
T is the time period
M is the mass of Sun
m is the mass of planet
R is the length of semi-major axis
G is the gravitational constant
Newton’s Laws and Kepler’s Laws
The authenticity of Kepler’s Laws is implied by Newton’s Laws

According to the first law of motion, an object accelerates only when a net force is applied which is in compliance with Kepler’s first Law which implies planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of its foci.

Also, the planet’s areal speed is constant which is in accordance with Kepler’s 2nd Law i.e. planets cover an equal area in equal time intervals.

Both Kepler’s 3rd Law and Newton’s 3rd Law imply that the force acting on the planet is proportional to the product of the masses of the planet and the Sun.What Is Gravitational Constant? The gravitational constant, denoted by G, is a fundamental physical constant that represents the strength of the gravitational force between two objects with mass.The gravitational constant is a fundamental constant in physics that plays a crucial role in the law of universal gravitation formulated by Sir Isaac Newton. This law describes the attractive force between two objects with mass and is given by the equation:

F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}where:

F is the gravitational force between two objects,
G is the gravitational constant,
m1? and m2? are the masses of the two objects,
r is the distance between the centers of the two masses.The gravitational constant is a proportionality factor that determines the strength of the gravitational force. Its value is approximately 6.67430×10?11m3kg?1s?2.

The gravitational constant is a fundamental constant, meaning its value is thought to be the same throughout the universe and across time. Despite its fundamental role in classical mechanics, it is worth noting that the theory of general relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, provides a more accurate description of gravity, especially in extreme conditions such as those near massive objects or at very high speeds.State the Universal Law of Gravitation
The Universal Law of Gravitation, a cornerstone of classical physics, explains the gravitational attraction between masses. In this article, we are going to learn the statement of the universal law of gravitation.

State the Universal Law of Gravitation

The Universal Law of Gravitation is a fundamental principle that describes the force of gravity between two objects. Formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, this law revolutionized our understanding of the universe.

Newton’s Insight into Gravitational Force

Sir Isaac Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This law can be expressed mathematically as:


F = G m1m2 / r2
where,

F is the gravitational force,
m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects,
r is the distance between the centers of the two masses, and
G is the gravitational constant.Implications of the Law

This law implies that the force of gravity decreases with distance and increases with the mass of the objects. It is a cornerstone in classical physics and is crucial for understanding celestial mechanics, including the orbits of planets and the behavior of objects on Earth.

The Universal Law of Gravitation is a key concept in physics, providing a comprehensive explanation for the forces that govern the motion of celestial bodies. It remains a fundamental part of our understanding of the physical universe.  What is Acceleration due to Gravity?
Acceleration due to Gravity is defined as the acceleration attained by an object due to the gravitational force of attraction. When a body is fallen toward the earth it experiences a change in its acceleration due to the gravitational pull (or force) of the Earth. This acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity. This is the acceleration that is attained by an object due to gravitational force. 

The acceleration that an object experiences as a result of the gravitational force is known as acceleration due to gravity, ms-2 is its SI unit. It has a direction and a magnitude so it is a vector quantity as a result.

The symbol g represents the acceleration due by gravity. Its typical value at sea level on the surface of the earth is 9.8 ms-2. The second law of motion and the law of universal gravitation of Newton serve as the foundation for its calculation.

Acceleration due to Gravity Formula
Mathematically, the acceleration due to gravity is directly proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the distance from the center of mass, so given as:

g? (m/r^2).   Units of Acceleration due to Gravity
The SI unit of Acceleration due to Gravity is m/s2.
The CGS unit of g is cm/s2.
And the dimensional formula of Acceleration due to Gravity is [ML0T-2].
?Acceleration due to Gravity
The Earth pulls any particle lying on its surface towards its center with a force known as gravitational pull of gravity. When a force acts on a body, it causes acceleration, and in the case of gravitation, this acceleration caused by gravity is referred to as acceleration due to gravity

Acceleration due to gravity, usually referred by the symbol ‘g‘ is the acceleration attained by any object in the universe due to gravitational force.

The SI unit of acceleration due to gravity is m/s2. 

The value of g in SI system is 9.806 ms-2. And the value of g in CGS system is 980 cm s-2.

The Dimensional Formula for g is [ M0 L1 T-2 ].

It has a magnitude as well as direction. Thus it is a vector quantity.Gravitational Potential Energy.The energy possessed by objects due to changes in their position in a gravitational field is called Gravitational Potential Energy. It is the energy of the object due to the gravitational forces. The work done per unit mass to bring the body from infinity to a location inside the gravitational field of any object is known as gravitational potential and the energy change here is called Gravitational Potential Energy. Let’s learn about Gravitational Potential Energy in detail in this article. What is Gravitational Potential Energy?
Gravitational Potential Energy is described as the energy of a body that arises from the gravitational force, that is when the gravitational force acts on a body and that force produces a type of potential energy known as gravitational potential energy. Now, if the position changes due to force, the amount of work done on the body by the force is the change in potential energy. 

Assume we have two items, one A and the other B. Now, suppose B’s location changes exclusively as a result of a certain force. Assume M’s location is changing owing to gravitational force, followed by a change in potential energy. The quantity of work done by the gravitational force is equal to the change in the location of the item.

As a result, the work done by the gravitational force will be equal to the change in potential energy going through from P to Q. Assume P is position 1 and Q is position 2. In this instance, the effort required to move the item from position 1 to position 2 is equal to the change in potential energy, which is equal to the potential energy at point 2 minus the potential energy at point 1.  Unit and Dimension of Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational Potential Energy is represented by the symbol U.

Its SI unit is J/kg.The dimensional formula of Gravitational Potential Energy is [M1L2T-2]

Gravitational Potential Energy Formula
Mathematically, Gravitational Potential Energy is given by the product of the mass (m) of the object, acceleration due to gravity (g), and height (h) above the ground as  .Gravitational Potential Energy,  V = mgh
where,
m is the mass of the object
g is the gravity of the Earth
h is the height at which object is held  .  Escape Velocity Definition . When an object reaches the speed that it is capable of breaking the Earth’s gravitational barrier then we say that it is travelling at escape velocity. i.e. Escape velocity is the minimum velocity that when an object travels at that speed can break the gravitational barrier of that celestial body. Escape Velocity Equation
The escape velocity equation is obtained by equating the kinetic energy of an object with mass m and travelling with a velocity of v and the gravitational potential energy of the same object. When the Kinetic energy of the object equals the gravitational energy of the celestial object the equation so obtained is called the Escape Velocity Equation. 

For Earth let the escape velocity is vc then the kinetic energy is 1/2 m(vc)2 if m is the mass of the object and now the gravitational potential energy is equal to the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy of the object is GMm/r where G is the universal gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Earth then,
1/2 m(vc)2 = GMm/r . Escape Velocity of Earth
The velocity required by an object to escape from Earth’s Gravitational Force is called the Escape Velocity of Earth. Now,

Let the escape velocity of the Earth be vc then,

vc = ?(2GM/r)

We know that,

GM/r2 = g (where g is Earth’s gravity)

vc = ?(2gr)

We know, Radius of Earth, r = 6.4 × 106 m, and

g = 9.8 m/s2

Now the escape velocity of the Earth, 

vc = ?(2 × 9.8 × 6.4 × 106)

? vc = 11.2 × 103 m/s 

? vc = 11.2 km/s

Thus, the escape velocity of the Earth is 11.2 km/s. Unit and Dimension of Escape Velocity
Escape velocity is the velocity that is required to break the gravitational barrier of any celestial object so the unit of escape velocity is similar to the unit of velocity.


The Escape Velocity is measured in Km/sec, m/sec, or in the other units of velocity and the dimensional formula of Escape Velocity is [LT-2].Artificial Satellites. Satellite
Satellites are objects that either occur naturally or man-made that used to go around a planet that is larger than it and rotates in its axis. There are various satellites including the moon present in the solar system. Therefore, on the basis of existence satellites are divided into two main categories:

Natural Satellites. Any celestial body present in space that revolves around a planet larger than it in a fixed orbit is called the natural satellites. The solar system consists of six planetary satellite system out of which 205 satellites are known to be natural satellites. These satellites are analogously larger and orbit in larger radii. Their surface are generally made up of various gases or Rocky Mountains.


e.g. The moon is the natural satellite of Earth similarly, Earth, Jupiter and Venus orbits around the Sun in their fixed orbit. Artificial Satellites
Any object that people have made and launched into orbit using rockets is called the artificial satellite. Presently, there are over a thousand active satellites orbiting the Earth. The satellite’s size, altitude and design depend on the use of the satellite. These satellites are also fitted with delicate instruments and cameras, made to rotate around planets in pre-fixed orbits and are launched by rockets from the Earth. Binding Energy of Satellites. Earth’s satellites are celestial objects that orbit the earth. Their movement is similar to that of the planets’ orbits around the Sun, and hence The rules of planetary motion established by Kepler are equally valid and are applicable to them. Earth’s satellite orbits around the earth are circular or elliptic. The moon is the Earth’s only natural satellite. Many countries, including India, have been able to launch artificial earth satellites for use in areas such as telecommunications, geophysics, and meteorology because of technological advancements. What is Gravitation?
Gravitation, or simply gravity, is the force that attracts two bodies together. All objects in the cosmos attract each other with a certain level of force, but due to the vast distances between the objects, the force is too faint to be noticed in most circumstances. Furthermore, while gravity’s range is infinite, the effect weakens as objects travel more away.

Gravitation potential energy: The energy stored in the body at a certain posture is known as potential energy. If a particle’s location changes as a result of forces operating on it, the change in its potential energy is equal to the amount of work the force does on the body. The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy of a body that arises from the force of gravity. The expression for the potential energy between satellite and the earth can be given as,

P.E = -GMm / r. Binding energy of Satellites or Energy of Orbiting Satellites. Binding Energy is the minimal amount of energy that must be delivered to the satellite in order to free of the planet’s gravitational attraction or the gravitational influence of the planet. The term “binding energy” refers to the energy that binds the satellite to the Earth. The gravitational attraction between the satellite and the planet will be overcome by this binding energy.",1,0,0,0,0
28,Evolution,"Evolutionary biology is the study of the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth. Earth came into existence sometime between 4 and 5 billion years ago. Life evolved on planet Earth about 3.5 billion years ago. Since then, approximately 15 million different species of organisms have evolved. But only about two million have been identified so far. In this article, we will discuss how the life of these, at first originated on earth and how such a vast variety of organisms evolved through variation and natural selection.Origin of Life
The origin of life is considered a unique event in the history of the universe. Several theories have been put forth to explain the origin of life.

Big Bang Theory: The universe is vast. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the universe. The Big Bang theory attempts to explain to us the origin of the universe and the creation of life. Developed in 1927, it is considered the most credible scientific explanation of how the universe was created. It suggests that through a process of expansion and explosion, hydrogen gas was created which led to the formation of stars, and their death (supernova) led to the creation of life.
Panspermia Theory: The panspermia hypothesis states that the seeds of life exist all over the universe and can be propagated through space from one location to another. For millennia, this idea has been a topic of philosophical debate. However, due to the lack of any validation, it remained merely speculative until a few decades ago.
Theory of Spontaneous Generation: The theory of spontaneous generation believed that life originated spontaneously from non-living decaying and rotting matter like straw and mud. This theory was disproved by Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur demonstrated that life comes from pre-existing life. He showed that in pre-sterilized flasks, life did not come from killed yeast while in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed yeast’.
Chemosynthetic Theory of Life: It was proposed by A.I. Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England. They proposed that the first form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules, e.g. RNA, protein, etc., and that the formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution, i.e., the formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents. The conditions on earth were – high temperature, volcanic storms, and reducing atmosphere containing CH4, NH3, etc.It was supported by S.L. Miller, an American scientist. In 1953, he created similar conditions on a laboratory scale. He created electric discharge in a closed flask containing Methane (CH4), Hydrogen (H2), Ammonia (NH3), and Water vapor (H2O) at 8000C. He observed the formation of amino acids. Miller’s experiment showed how simple molecules could be assembled into the more complex molecules necessary for life by natural processes.Evolution of Life Forms – A Theory
The formation of complex organisms through ‘gradual change’ from simple ancestral types over the course of geological time is termed Evolution.

The theory of evolution is a shortened form of the term “theory of evolution by natural selection,” which was proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the nineteenth century. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a phenomenon called natural selection. In the theory of natural selection, organisms produce more offspring than are able to survive in their environment.

Those that are better physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce. Those that are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not reach an age when they can reproduce or produce fewer offspring than their counterparts. Natural selection is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms are the ones that reproduce most successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next generation. Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution of life that it became established as a scientific theory.

Evidence for Evolution
The evidence supporting organic evolution is derived from a number of fields of Biology. Those discussed here are:

Palaeontological evidence: Different-aged rock sediments contain fossils of different life forms that probably died during the formation of the particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern organisms. They represent extinct organisms, e.g., Dinosaurs. A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological period in which they existed. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history of Earth.
Embryological evidence: It was proposed by Ernst Heckel based on the observation of certain features during the embryonic stage common to all vertebrates that are absent in adults. For example, the embryos of all vertebrates including humans develop a row of vestigial gill slits just behind the head but it is a functional organ only in fish and not found in any other adult vertebrates.
Morphological evidence: Though organisms of different species and groups are quite different from each other, they still retain certain common features. Morphological evidence for evolution is derived from:
Divergent evolution: Species from a common ancestral origin evolve similar anatomical parts (called homologous structures) but with dissimilar functions. For example, whales, bats, cheetahs, and humans (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs.
Convergent evolution: It creates analogous structures that have similar forms or functions but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. Both sharks and dolphins have similar body forms, yet are only distantly related: sharks are fish and dolphins are mammals.
Molecular evidence: Similarities in proteins and genes performing a given function among diverse organisms give clues to common ancestry. These biochemical similarities point to the same shared ancestry as structural similarities among diverse organisms.Adaptive Radiation
Adaptive radiation is a rapid increase in the number of species with a common ancestor, characterized by great ecological and morphological diversity. This process occurs due to natural selection.

An example of adaptive radiation is Darwin finches, found on Galapagos Island. A large variety of finches is present in Galapagos Island that arose from a single species, which reached this land accidentally. As a result, many new species have evolved, diverged, and adapted to occupy new habitats. These finches have developed different eating habits and different types of beaks to suit their feeding habits. The insectivorous, blood-sucking, and other species of finches with varied dietary habits have evolved from a single seed-eating finch ancestor.Biological Evolution
Branching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts of the Darwinian Theory of Evolution.

Branching descent is the process of the development of a new species from a single common descendant. New species developed and become geographically adapted to a new environment. This results in reproductive isolation and finally to the development of a new species.
Natural Selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others.
Darwin asserted that variations, which are heritable and which make resource utilization better for few will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence for a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more progeny and there would be a change in population characteristics and hence new forms appear to arise.

Mechanism of Evolution
Various theories about the mechanism of evolution have been proposed; some of them such as Lamarck’s theory of “Inheritance of acquired characters” and De Vries’ theory of ‘mutation’ are now of historical importance only. Darwin’s theory of Natural selection still holds ground but was modified with progress in genetics and developed into the Modern synthetic theory which is regarded as the most valid theory of evolution.

Darwin talked about variation but did not know about the sources of variation. With progress in genetics, the sources of variation were discovered and Darwin’s original theory of Natural Selection was modified. This new theory was termed Neo-Darwinism or Modern Synthetic Theory.",0,0,0,1,0
29,human Helath and Dieseas,"Health
According to the World Health Organisation, health can be defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.

How Can We Achieve a Good Health?
The following factors are necessary to achieve good health:

Balanced diet
Personal hygiene
Regular exercise (yoga)
Awareness about diseases and their effects
Vaccination or immunization against diseases caused by pathogens
Proper disposal of wastes
Control of vectors, which carry diseases
Consumption of hygienic food and water
Disease
A disease can be defined as an illness or sickness that shows specific signs or symptoms.

Causes of Diseases
Heredity: It is the transmission of some deficiencies or defects which is inherited by a child from the parents by birth.
Infections: These can be caused by some pathogens, i.e. disease-causing organisms.
Unhealthy lifestyle: It includes a lack of exercise and consumption of tobacco and alcohol.
Diseases Can Be Classified Into
Infectious or Communicable Diseases: Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by some disease-causing organisms or pathogens, e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoans. These diseases can be passed from an unhealthy person to a healthy person.
Non-infectious or Non-Communicable Diseases: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are diseases that are not transmitted by pathogens. They can be caused by unhealthy lifestyles, unbalanced diets, improper vaccination, etc. They are also known as chronic diseases as they remain for a long duration e.g. diabetes, heart ailments, cancer, etc.Effect of Pathogens on Our Body
Diseases are caused by the pathogens in our bodies. The pathogens can take entry into our body in various modes and replicate. They also disturb the normal activities of the body which may lead to some undesirable changes and ultimately damage the organs in reference to their functions.

Adaptations of Pathogens in Our Body
Pathogens have to adapt in the host body for their survival e.g. if a pathogen takes entry in our gut, it must go to the way for survival against low pH and some digestive enzymes.Allergies (Allergic Diseases)
These are the conditions caused by the hypersensitivity of the immune system to many harmless substances present around us. When the immune system responds to any foreign substances like pollen, dust, or any food which does not cause any reactions in most people, then allergies occur. The antibodies produced against these reactions are of IgE type (Ig stands for immunoglobulin-a class of protein).

Examples of Some Common Allergens (Allergens Cause Allergies)
Some common examples of allergens are outdoor pollutants including ozone and diesel exhaust, indoor pollutants like tobacco smoke and nitrogen dioxide, some food items like peanuts and eggs, microbial products, mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. 

Symptoms of Allergies
Symptoms of allergies include sneezing, nasal discharge, watery eyes, and difficulty in breathing.

Allergies are caused because of the production of histamine and serotonin.
Anti-histamines, adrenalin, and steroids reduce the symptoms of allergy.
Autoimmunity
It is a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakes its own body tissues for foreign agents and starts attacking them. Autoimmune diseases cause inflammation which affects many parts of the body. Examples of such diseases are rheumatoid arthritis (attacks joints) and type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system starts destroying Islets of Langerhans, the cells in the pancreas which produce insulin hormone.

Immune System in the Body
It comprises lymphoid organs, cells, organs, and antibodies.

Role Played by the Immune System
It shows allergic reactions.
It distinguishes between self and non-self cells and fights against non-self or foreign antigens.
It is important in organ transplantation.
It is responsible for the production of memory cells or mast cells.
Lymphoid Organs 
Primary, secondary, and tertiary lymphoid organs include different types of leukocytes or white blood cells which fight against infections. Bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all blood cells are produced including lymphocytes. 

The thymus gland is found in the upper front part of the chest, behind the sternum which is made up of two lobes. It is also known as the ‘Throne of immunity’ or ‘training schools of T-lymphocytes.’
The spleen is an organ that filters blood. They are also known as the ‘graveyard of red blood cells’. 
The lymph nodes are the parts of the lymphatic system which trap antigens inside the tissue or lymph fluid. It leads to the activation of lymphocytes located in the lymph nodes. The lining of the major tracts, i.e., respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts, consists of lymphoid tissue. It is called ‘Mucosal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue’ (MALT).AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome)
HIV-AIDS is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the genome of which is RNA, enclosed in an envelope and consists of reverse transcriptase (transcribes single-stranded RNA into DNA). It interferes with the protein synthesis machinery and the body’s ability to fight against infection.

Modes of Transmission
The HIV virus is transmitted through contact with the infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids.

Symptoms
Flu-like symptoms can be seen, e.g., fever, fatigue, and sore throat.
Other symptoms include weight loss, fever or night sweats, fatigue, and frequent infections.
Cure
There is no cure for AIDS but antiretroviral regimens can minimize the effects by preventing some secondary infections.

Transmission of HIV-Infection 
Transmission of HIV infection can be happened by:
Direct contact with certain body fluids from a suffered person. These fluids are blood, semen, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, breast milk, etc.
Having sexual contact with multiple partners.
Transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products. Contamination of blood can be considered if the person suffers from certain cancers, anemia, and thalassemia.
Sharing infected needles or syringes by drug addicts who take drugs intravenously.
Infected pregnant mother to her child through the placenta.
How HIV Affects the Body? 
HIV destroys T-cells or helper cells (CD4 cells), which are critical to the immune system. These cells are responsible to keep us healthy and protect against common diseases and infections. The macrophages, a type of WBCs are infected. The genomic RNA of the virus replicates with the help of an enzyme, reverse transcriptase, and forms viral DNA which enters the host cell and produces viral particles. HIV enters the T-cells and multiplies in the blood which further attacks other T-cells. This cycle goes on and the T-lymphocytes decrease in the infected person. HIV weakens the body’s natural defense mechanisms and then, symptoms appear.

30,Transgenic Animal,"Transgenic animals refer to animals that have been genetically modified to carry and exhibit an additional foreign gene. While various animals, including rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows, and fish, have been genetically modified to be transgenic, it is worth noting that the vast majority (over 95%) of transgenic animals in existence are mice. Common reasons for the development of transgenic animals are:In order to examine how genes are controlled and how they impact a person’s development and daily functions, transgenic animals can be particularly developed, for example, in the study of intricate growth-related factors like insulin-like growth factors. Information regarding the biological function of the factor in the body is discovered by introducing genes from different species that modify the creation of the factor and by examining the biological repercussions that follow. 
Transgenic animals are commonly used to enhance our comprehension of how genes influence the onset and progression of diseases. They are specifically engineered to serve as models for human diseases, enabling researchers to investigate and develop new treatments. Transgenic animal models are available for numerous human diseases, including but not limited to cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer’s.
Researchers are creating transgenic mice to evaluate the safety of vaccines before conducting human trials. Specifically, they are testing the reliability of these mice to assess the safety of the polio vaccine. If the results are promising, transgenic mice may replace the use of monkeys in evaluating vaccine safety.
Toxicology/safety testing of chemicals is applied to testing medication toxicity. Genes are inserted into transgenic animals to increase their sensitivity to toxins compared to non-transgenic animals. After which, the impacts of the harmful compounds are evaluated. We can get data faster by testing for toxicity in these animals.
Biological products used in medicines for treating certain diseases can be expensive to produce. One solution is to create transgenic animals by introducing a specific portion of DNA or genes that code for useful biological products, such as human proteins like ?-1-antitrypsin, used to treat emphysema. Researchers are also attempting to use transgenic animals to treat conditions like phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis. The first transgenic cow, named Rosie, produced milk fortified with human protein in 1997. The milk contained human alpha-lactalbumin and was a more nutritionally balanced product for human babies than natural cow milk.",0,0,0,1,0
31,DNA Cloning,"DNA cloning is the procedure of comprising multiple identical copies of a portion of DNA. This procedure necessitates the use of cloning vectors with the following characteristics:

It should be smaller in size but capable of transporting a large DNA insert.
The cloning vector should have a replication origin so that it can replicate spontaneously in the host organism.
There should be a restriction site
It should consist of a selectable marker to screen recombinant organisms.
It should have several cloning sites.
Origin of Replication
The origin of replication is a specific DNA sequence in the chromosome that is responsible for initiating replication. Consequently, for any foreign piece of DNA to multiply in an organism, it must be a component of a chromosome(s) with a certain specific sequence referred to as the ‘origin of replication’.The genomic regions where DNA replication begins are commonly referred to as DNA replication origins. However, they do have at least two distinct elements: the DNA region that will form the pre-replication complex and that will be recognized and bound by specialized proteins.

Plasmids
Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can reproduce autonomously, as they do not depend on an organism’s chromosomal DNA for replication. As a result, plasmids are often referred to as extrachromosomal DNA. Plasmids are important genetic engineering tools as they help in gene cloning and gene therapy.

Plasmids are present in bacteria and some eukaryotes. A plasmid can range in size from 1 to 200 kb and produces enzymes that can break down antibiotics or heavy metals. Plasmids are classified into five types: fertility F-plasmids, resistance plasmids, virulence plasmids, degradation plasmids, and Col plasmids.

Recombinant DNA Technology
Recombinant DNA technology modifies the phenotype of an organism (the host) by using a genetically modified vector. This cloning vector is injected and incorporated into the organism’s genome.

So, basically, this process involves essentially entails inserting a foreign portion of DNA into the genome that consists of our genes of interest. The gene which is included is the recombinant gene and the technique is referred to as the recombinant DNA technology. Here we will learn about the major tools of recombinant DNA technology.

Tools of Recombinant DNA Technology
The following is a discussion of the various tools used for various purposes. The above explanation has shown us that key tools such as restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors, and host organisms are essential for genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology to be successful.

Restriction Enzymes
The position at which the desired gene is inserted into the vector genome is greatly influenced by the restriction enzymes utilized in recombinant DNA technology. E-coli was the first restriction enzyme to be isolated in 1963 from the development of bacteriophage in the laboratory.

This enzyme was able to cleave  DNA but not the precise side of DNA cleavage. In 1970 Hemeltan Smith and his co-worker isolate the restriction enzyme activity from the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd, showing it was able to cleave DNA at a specific site that is referred to as Hind II recognized six double Standard DNA Sequence that is GI, PY, PU, AC.

In addition to Hind II, there are approximately 900 restriction enzymes known, each of which recognizes a different recognition sequence. These enzymes were isolated from over 230 bacterial strains.

Restriction enzymes are part of a larger class of enzymes referred to as nucleases.  Nucleases degrade the DNA Molecules by breaking the phosphodiesterase bond that is one molecule nucleotide the next in the DNA strength. Exonucleases and endonucleases are two different types of nucleases. Exonucleases remove nucleotides one at a time from the ends of the DNA whereas,  endonucleases comprised cuts at specific positions within the DNA. The DNA is cut at specified locations by restriction endonucleases, which are sequence-specific and typically palindrome sequences.

For example, E-coli enzyme Exonucleases degrade just one end of the double standard molecules and leave single standard DNA as a product. Sequences read identically in a 5? à 3? direction on both strands. This is also accurate when measured from 3? to 5?.. ",0,0,0,1,0
32,Principals of Inheritance,"Inheritance is the term given to the process by which characters are passed from parents to offspring which forms the basis of heredity. Heredity is the process of passing down genetic traits from parents to offspring. The degree of difference in characters between a parent and offspring is called variation. All these are studied under genetics which deals with the study of inheritance and variation of characters passed from parents to offspring. The first proper documented study of this inheritance and variation was done by G.J. Mendel which is why he is considered the father of genetics.Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance
Mendel used garden peas (Pisum sativum) to perform his hybridization experiment to study genetics for seven years i.e. from 1856 to 1863 which led him to propose the laws of inheritance. He first prepared self-pollination of the pea lines to obtain true breeds of particular characters and then performed cross-pollination/artificial pollination of those pea lines having contrasting characters. He selected seven pairs of contrasting characters i.e. 14-true breeding pea plant varieties.Inheritance of One Gene
Mendel crossed tall and dwarf pea plants collected their seeds, and grew them to produce the first hybrid generation called the first filial progeny or F1 generation. Then he crosses the seeds to obtain the second filial progeny or F2 generation. Similarly, he crossed other contrasting characters containing plants to obtain F1 and F2 generations.   After these crossings, he concluded that;

F1 generations always resemble one of their parent i.e. the dominant one.
F2 generation has offspring that represents both dominant and recessive parents i.e. 3/4th of the offspring resembles the dominant parent whereas 1/4th offspring resembles the recessive parent. 
The typical genotypic ratio after the F1 generation is usually 1:2:1 and the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.
All the offspring in both generations resemble their parent’s type and no intermediate characters or blending of characters were seen. 
These results were obtained for all the traits. 
Monohybrid Cross
The above type of crossing that Mendel performed with only true-breeding pea line studying only one particular character is called monohybrid cross i.e. crossing of only one selected character. E.g. Homozygous tall (TT) crossed with homozygous dwarf (tt).Genotypic ratio: 1 TT: 2Tt: 1tt = 1:2:1
Phenotypic ratio: 3 Tall: 1 Dwarf = 3:1Law of Incomplete Dominance
It states that in some cases there is no dominant or recessive gene present i.e. both the parent will be expressed in the offspring but in an intermediate or mixed manner. E.g. snapdragon or dog flower (Antirrhinum sp.) where the red flower is dominant over white. When expressed as a heterozygous condition an intermediate expression occurs. Genotypic ratio: 1 RR: 2 Rr: 1 rr = 1:2:1
Phenotypic ratio: 1 Red: 2 Pink: 1 white = 1:2:1Co-dominance
It states that in some cases there is no dominant gene or recessive gene, both genes act dominant and express themselves simultaneously in heterozygous conditions. E.g. ABO blood grouping in humans. It is controlled by the I-gene and has three types of alleles; IA, IB, i. IA and IB are dominant whereas i is recessive. When IA and IB are present together they are both expressed. Punnett Square Method
British geneticist R.C. Punnett developed a graphical representation called Punnett square to calculate the possibility of all possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross.Inheritance of Two Genes
Mendel also worked and crossed pea plants that differed into two characters and got a typical phenotypic ratio of  9 : 3 : 3: 1 and genotype ratio  1: 2: 2: 4: 1: 2: 1: 2: 1.Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
Mendel’s work was not accepted at that time because due to a lack of communication between the scientific communities, the use of maths in his work was not acceptable to some biologists, lack of physical proof of his work on the genes, etc. reasons. Then after years of his death, his work was rediscovered by three scientists namely Carl Correns, Hugo De Vries, and Von Tschermrk independently. They were able to do so due to the development of a microscope so that cell division and its chromosomes were observable. Linkage and Recombination
The term linkage and crossing over is introduced by TH Morgan. The physical association of parental genes in a chromosome is called linkage, such genes are called Linked genes and recombination is used to describe non-parental gene combinations. When two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportions of parental gene combinations were much higher than in the non-parental type. Linked genes are exceptions to the law of independent assortment (3rd law). 

Later Morgan’s student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between genes on the same chromosome as a measure of distance between genes and mapped their position on chromosomes. Genetic maps are used in human genome projects (HGP).Pleiotropy and Polygenic Inheritance
Both these phenomena are exceptions to Mendel’s laws of Inheritance. In pleiotropy, a single gene can exhibit multiple phenotypic expressions. It is the effect of a gene on metabolic pathways which contributes to different phenotypes. E.g. White-eye mutation in Drosophila results in changes in body color, and starch grain size in pea seed and seed size where a single gene control both starch grain size and seed shape.

Whereas polygenic inheritance is the condition in which a character’s expression is controlled by the number of genes. E.g. height of a human, human skin color which is controlled by three genes A, B, and C where AABBCC leads to the darkest skin color, AaBbCc leads to intermediate skin color, and aabbcc leads to the lightest skin color or albino condition. Sex Determination
The chromosome involved in sex determination is called the sex chromosome (Allosome). Whereas the chromosome in an organism other than the sex chromosome is called somatic chromosomes (Autosomes). Henking (1891) studied spermatogenesis in some insects in which he observed that 50% of sperm received a nuclear structure after spermatogenesis, other 50% of sperm did not receive it, he named them as ‘X-body’ is now called X-chromosome. There are various mechanisms of sex determination, these are;

XX-XY type sex determination: Male is heterogametic (X & Y) and female is homogametic (X only). The numbers of chromosomes are the same and the male determines the sex of the offspring. If sperm containing the Y chromosome fertilizes the egg then the offspring will be a male and if sperm containing the X chromosome fertilizes the egg the offspring will be female. E.g. Human & Drosophila.
ZZ-ZW type sex determination: The male is homogametic (with two Z) and the female is heterogametic (Z & W) i.e. the female determines the sex of the offspring. If the female egg contains a Z chromosome then the offspring will be a male and if the egg contains a W chromosome the offspring will be a female. E.g. Birds, butterflies, reptiles, some fishes, etc.
XX-XO type sex determination: Here, the male is heterogametic, i.e. XO (produce gametes with X and gametes without X) and the female is homogametic, i.e. XX (all gametes are with X chromosomes). The male determines the sex of the offspring i.e. if the male sperm contains an X chromosome then the offspring will be female and if the male sperm lacks any sex chromosome then the offspring will be a male. E.g. Many insects such as grasshoppers, cockroaches, spiders, bedbugs, etc.
Haplo-Diploidy type sex determination: Here females are diploid (32 chromosomes) and males are Haploids (16 chromosomes). The males (Drone) produce sperm by mitosis thus they do not have fathers and thus cannot have sons, but have grandfathers and grandsons. Seen in Honey Bees. Mutation
The mutation is a sudden heritable change in DNA sequences resulting in changes in the genotype (and sometimes phenotype) of an organism. It is the alteration in chromosomes that result in abnormalities or aberrations that can be easily observed in cancer cells. The substance that causes mutations are called Mutagens and these are of two types; 

Physical factors: X-rays, gamma rays, UV rays, etc. 
Chemical factors: Mustard gas, phenol, formalin, etc. Pedigree Analysis
The analysis of a trait or traits in several generations of a family is called pedigree analysis. It is represented in the form of a hierarchical chart that is called the pedigree tree. It helps to trace the inheritance of a specific trait or abnormality or disease.Genetic Disorders
The disorders that occur due to defect in the genetic structure of a person is called a genetic disorder. These disorders can get transmitted from one generation to another. There are mainly 2 types of genetic disorders Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders.

Mendelian Disorders
It occurs due to mutation or alteration in a single gene. These are transmitted to the offspring and can be traced in a family using pedigree analysis.

Color blindness: It is a sex-linked recessive disorder that affects either the red or green cone of the eye failing to discriminate between red and green color. Occurs due to mutation in certain genes present on the X-Chromosome that occurs in 8% of males and only about 0.4% of females. The son of a woman who carries the gene has a 50% chance of being color blind. A daughter will not normally be color blind unless her mother is a carrier and her father is color blind. It shows the following genotypes; normal male XY, normal female XX, color-blind male XCY, color-blind female XCXC, and color-blind carrier (Female) XCX. 
Haemophilia: It is also called bleeder’s disease or royal disease. It is a sex-linked recessive disorder that affects a single protein that is part of a cascade of proteins involved in blood clotting is affected. The heterozygous female (carrier) for hemophilia may transmit the disease to sons. The possibility of a female becoming hemophilic is rare because the mother has to be at least a carrier and the father should be hemophilic. It shows the following genotypes; normal male XY, normal female XX, hemophilic male XhY, hemophilic female XhXh, and hemophilic carrier (Female) XXh.
Sickle-Cell anemia:  It is an autosome-linked recessive disorder that is controlled by single pair of alleles HBA and HbS. It is transmitted from parents to the offspring when both partners are carriers of the gene. The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) for Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the hemoglobin molecule that results in the change in the shape of the RBC from a biconcave disc to an elongated sickle-like structure. It shows the following genotypes; normal HbA HbA, carrier HbAHbS, and affected HbSHbS.
Phenylketonuria (PKU): It is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an inborn error in the metabolic pathway results in an individual lacking the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the brain resulting in mental retardation and skin pigmentation. It is transmitted from parents to the offspring when both parents are carriers. It shows the following genotypes; normal AA, carrier Aa, and affected aa.
Thalassemia: It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutation or deletion that results in the reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains (? and ? chains) that leads to the formation of abnormal Hb. Blood disease is transmitted from parents to the offspring when both partners are carriers. It shows the following genotypes; normal AA, carrier Aa, and affected aa It has two types;
?-thalassemia: Controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2 on Chromosome 16.
?-Thalassemia: Controlled by single gene HBB on Chromosome 11.Chromosomal Disorders
They are caused due to absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes that results due to the failure of segregation of chromatids during the cell-division cycle resulting in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), which is called Aneuploidy.

Down’s Syndrome: It occurs due to an additional copy of chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21= 45+XX or 45A+XY). It shows the following symptoms; short stature, small round head, furrowed tongue, partially open mouth, broad palm with characteristic palm crease, and physical, psychomotor, and mental development is retarded.
Klinefelter’s Syndrome: It occurs due to the presence of an additional copy of the X-chromosome resulting in a karyotype of 47A + XXY that is a result of fertilization of an abnormal egg (Containing XX) with sperm containing the ‘Y’ chromosome. It shows the following symptoms; an individual has overall masculine development, however, the feminine development (development of breast, i.e., Gynaecomastia) also occurs making the individual sterile.
Turner’s syndrome: It is due to the absence of one of the X chromosomes, i.e., 45 autosomes with X0. It shows the following symptoms; females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary and they lack other secondary sexual characteristics.",0,0,0,1,0
33,Biotechnology,"The name “biotechnology” comes from the Greek words “bios,” which means “life,” “techno,” which means “technology,” and “logos,” which means “language,” or “proof.” Biotechnology is the technical use of living organisms for a variety of purposes, including food, medicine, medicines, and recycling. Biotechnology is the combination of biology and technology for human benefit and sustainable development. Biotechnology is a technology that uses biological systems, living organisms, or parts of them, to produce or create various products.

The Benefits of biotechnology help in overcoming numerous problems across several industries. While the most common applications of biotechnology are in the fields of medicine, the environment, marine biology, and industry, there are other applications as well. Biotechnology provides farmers now have access to technologies with tools that can reduce production costs and improve management. For instance, some biotechnology crops can be modified to withstand particular herbicides, simplifying and improving weed control. According to legend, the term “biotechnology”, sometimes referred to as “biotech”, was first used in 1919 by the Hungarian engineer Karl Erecki. Biotechnology is a fast-growing career option with emerging demand in fields such as pharmaceuticals, animal husbandry, agriculture, health care, medicine, genetic engineering, etc. We are studying Genetic Engineering, Bioinformatics, and Bioprocess Engineering under Modern Biotechnology.

Genetic engineering is the procedure of altering an organism’s genetic composition. A cloning vector is typically used to insert a desired gene, such as pest-resistant or antibiotic-resistant genes, into a host. It integrates the desired gene into the host genome, and transformation can be seen in the host phenotype.

Through bioprocess engineering, the production of many products can be accelerated and carried out on a large scale, including enzymes, antibodies, organic acids, vaccines, etc. The desired microorganisms are developed under controlled, sterile, and appropriate conditions for this purpose.

In bioinformatics, biological data such as genome and protein sequences are stored, preserved, and retrieved for many different purposes.

Principles of Biotechnology
Among many, the two fundamental techniques that  contributed to the development of  modern biotechnology are :

Genetic engineering: This technique is used to modify the chemistry of genetic material (DNA and RNA), insert it into host organisms, and consequently alter the phenotypic of the host organism.
Preservation of sterile (microbial contamination-free) environment during chemical engineering processes to allow large-scale growth of only suitable microbe/eukaryotic cells for the production of biotechnological products such as antibiotics, vaccines, enzymes, etc.
The following are the main methods used in genetic engineering:

The donor organism’s DNA fragment is extracted.
It is put into the DNA of the vector.
It is subsequently transmitted to the proper host.
Cloning of the host organism’s recombinant DNA.
Recombinant DNA
This restriction is overridden by genetic engineering techniques such as recombinant DNA production, gene cloning, and gene transfer, which enable us to extract and introduce only one or a small number of desired genes without introducing unwanted genes into the desired organism",0,0,0,1,0
34,Oranganism and Population,"What is an Organism? The organism is defined as the minimal functional unit of life. An Organism can grow, reproduce, and respond to its environment. It is made up of cells that work together to keep it alive. Organisms have specific structures and organs that enable them to perform different functions necessary for their survival. They interact with other organisms and their surroundings in complex ecosystems, forming food chains and ecological relationships. Organisms have the ability to adapt to their environment and evolve over time to increase their chances of survival.Population 
Groups of individuals from the same species that share or compete for similar resources and live together in a defined geographical area constitute a population.
The population also has the potential to interbreed. Populations are dynamic and can change over time due to factors like birth, death, immigration (individuals moving into the population), and emigration (individuals moving out of the population). They can exhibit certain characteristics and behaviors specific to their species, which may be influenced by genetic variations and environmental factors. At the population level, evolutionary changes take place through natural selection.Population Attributes
The population have the following attributes (that individual don’t have)
Death and Birth Rate           
The population has death and birth rates-
Death Rate is the number of people per thousand who die in a particular area during a particular period of time.
Birth Rate in a place is the number of babies born there for every 1000 people during a particular period of time.
Sex Ratio
The population has a sex ratio. The sex ratio is the number of females per 1000 males. It compares the number of females and males in a population group.
Age Pyramid          
Individuals of various ages make up a population at any given moment. When the percentage of individuals of a certain age or age group is graphed for the population, it produces an age pyramid. The shape of the pyramids is an indicator of the population’s growth status, which can be (a) increasing, (b) stable, or (c) decreasing.Size of a Population                              
It indicates the status of the population in the habitat. It is measured in the form of population density, that is the number of individuals per square unit of the area. Its evaluation helps in, for example, investigating the impact of a predator in a habitat or the effect of a pesticide application in an area.
Population Growth
The population of particular species is not always constant, it changes over time. These changes are affected by numerous factors, including the accessibility of food, the existence of predators, and unfavorable weather conditions. These changes indicate whether the population is increasing or decreasing. There are four processes that affect the density of a population in a given habitat:                                                                                                           
Natality: Refers to the number of live births in a specific population during a certain period of time.             
Mortality: Refers to the number of death in a specific population during a certain period of time.                         
Immigration: The number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration.                            
Emigration: The number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and went elsewhere during the time period under consideration.Populations grow through births and immigration and decline through deaths and emigration. Population density is mainly impacted by births and deaths, while the other two factors(immigration and emigration) become significant only in specific circumstances.opulation Growth Models
These are used to analyze and predict the growth of organisms, populations, and biological systems over time. Helps to understand the dynamics of growth, the underlying factors that drive it, and how it changes over time. Exponential Growth Models 
Assumes that there are no limiting factors and that resources are unlimited. The size of the population increases at a rate that is proportional to the current size of the population, leading to a steady increase in population size over time. Graphically, represented as ‘J’ shaped.If in a population of size N, the birth rates are represented as b and death rates as d, then the increase or decrease in N during a unit time period t (dN/dt) will be
dN/dt = (b – d) × N.The r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of natural increase’, it assesses the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on population growth.
Logistics Growth Models
Describes the population in an area having limited resources(called as nature’s carrying capacity), initially it exhibits a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration, finally when the population density attains the carrying capacity, it reaches an asymptote. Defines the concept of ‘survival of the fittest’.
Graphically, represented as a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called Verhulst – Pearl Logistic Growth. Described by the following equation:
dN/dt = rN{K-N}/K.N = Population density at time t
r = Intrinsic rate of natural increase
K = Carrying capacity.Life History Variation
Population in a habitat evolves to maximize their reproductive fitness, also known as Darwinian fitness(high “r” value). Through a specific set of selection pressures, organisms adapt to achieve the most efficient reproductive strategy. The biotic and abiotic factors of habitat influence the evolution of organisms.
Population Interaction 
Two different species of population interact with each other to form interspecific interactions, that could be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to one of the species or both. Interaction between the two species can be classified as:   
Competition (both species suffer),                 
Predation and Parasitism (one benefits and the other suffers),                                     
Commensalism (one benefits and the other is unaffected),                                        
Amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and
Mutualism (both species benefit).Predation acts as a natural mechanism through which energy fixed by plants is transferred to higher trophic levels in an ecosystem. It also keeps the prey population under control, for example, biological control methods used in agriculture pest control are based on this method. Predators contribute to the preservation of species diversity by lessening the level of competition among prey species.
Predators are prudent in nature. To minimize the effects of predation, prey species have developed various defense mechanisms. For example, The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator, some insects use camouflage. 

Plants have developed various defense mechanisms (mechanical and chemical) to protect themselves from their predators (herbivores). For example, thorns on the cactus, many plants produce and store poisonous substances.
Competition
Competition can be described as a phenomenon in which the presence of one species has a notable negative impact on the fitness of another species, as measured by its intrinsic rate of increase (also known as “r”). 
With limited resources the competitively superior species will eliminate the other species. For example, with the introduction of goats on the Galapagos island Abingdon tortoise became extinct within a decade. For the same resources, the totally unrelated species can also compete.
Another form of competition is competitive release. If a species is limited to a small geographic region due to the presence of a more competitive species, removing the competitive species through experimental means can result in a significant expansion of the limited species’ range. Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ competing for the same resources the closely related species can not co-exist indefinitely, the inferior one will be eliminated.
Parasitism
Parasites negatively impact the host’s survival, growth, and reproductive capabilities, and reduce the population density. Parasites have a complex life cycles, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors. Special adaptations have been adopted by parasites like the presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system, and high reproductive capacity. Many of the parasites are host specific. Parasitism negatively impact the host’s survival, growth, and reproductive capabilities, and reduce the population density.
Types of Parasitism:
Ectoparasites: Feed on the external surface of the host organism, for example, ticks on dogs and licks on humans.
Endoparasites: These are those that live inside the host body at a different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, etc.,)
Brood parasitism in birds: The eggs of the parasitic bird resemble the host’s egg in size and color. The parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of the host bird and depends on the host to incubate them. Example cuckoo(host) and crow(parasite.ommensalism
Commensalism  is an interaction in which one species is positively impacted while the other is unaffected – neither benefiting nor being harmed. For example, cattle egret (benefits) living in close association with grazing cattle (unaffected), clown fish (benefits) living among sea anemones (unaffected).                           
Mutualism
Mutualism interaction provides benefits to both the interacting species. For example, Lichens(Fungi + Algae), the mycorrhizal (fungi +roots of higher plants).
Mutualism can also be seen in plant and animal relationships. Plants provide animals with nectar and fruits, and in turn, animals help plants in pollination and dispersal of seeds.
Plant-animal interactions often involve the co-evolution of the mutualists. For example, the interaction between a fig tree and female wasp. Fig tree gets pollinated with wasp’s help and wasp gets nectar(food) and a site for laying eggs.",0,0,0,1,0
35,Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry,"Importance of Chemistry in Everyday Life. Importance of Chemistry in Everyday Life: The scientific study of matter’s properties and behavior is known as chemistry. It is a natural science that studies the elements that makeup matter, as well as the compounds, made up of atoms, molecules, and ions: their composition, structure, qualities, and behavior, as well as the changes that occur when they mix with other things.

In this article, we have provided the importance of chemistry in everyday life, including the uses and applications of various compounds of chemistry and how Chemistry affects our daily life. What is Chemistry?
Chemistry is a discipline that falls somewhere between physics and biology in terms of scope. It is also referred to as the “core science” since it provides a fundamental framework for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Chemistry, for example, explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of lunar soil (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (criminology) (forensics).

Chemistry is a discipline of science concerned with the study of matter, including its structure, composition, and changes that occur when it is exposed to various situations. As a result, chemistry not only investigates the qualities of matter, but also how and why it changes. How Chemistry is Important in Everyday Life?
Chemistry is like our everyday lives unseen behind-the-scenes wizard, quietly influencing everything around us in a myriad of ways. It is found in the air we breathe, a mixture of gases that chemists comprehend and control for a variety of uses, including carbon dioxide for photosynthesis in plants and oxygen for human survival. Importance of Chemistry in Medicines
Medicines or pharmaceuticals are chemical substances that are used to treat diseases and relieve pain. Chemistry has made significant contributions to health care. Chemistry, for example, aids in the manufacture and application of surgical materials (sutures, artificial skin, and sterile materials). What is Matter ? Matter is the substance that makes up everything in the physical universe. It is anything that has mass and occupies space. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms, which are the basic building blocks of all chemical elements. These atoms can comLiquids
The most visible physical properties of a liquid are volume retention and conformation to the shape of its container. When a liquid substance is poured into a vessel, it takes on the shape of the vessel and will remain inside as long as the substance is liquid. Furthermore, when a liquid is poured from one vessel to another, it retains its volume but not its shape (as long as there is no vaporization or temperature change). 
bine to form molecules, which in turn can combine to create more complex substances.  Matter Definition

Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass. 
Three States of Matter

One of the distinct forms that the various phases of matter take are the condition of the matter. In everyday life, four states of matter can be found: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many other states, such as Bose-Einstein condensate and neutron degenerate matter, are thought to exist only in extremely cold or dense matter. Other states, such as quark-gluon plasmas, are thought to be possible but are still considered theoretical for the time being.Solids
One of the three fundamental states of matter is solid. A solid forms from a liquid or gas because the energy of atoms lowers as they take up a somewhat organised, three-dimensional structure. 


Solids have characteristics that distinguish them from liquids and gases. All solids, for example, can withstand forces applied perpendicular or parallel to a surface (i.e., normal or shear loads, respectively). Such properties are determined by the properties of the atoms that make up the solid, how those atoms are arranged, and the forces that exist between them. The properties of solids are:

One of the fundamental states of matter is solid state.
The rigidity of solids distinguishes them from liquids and gases.
Because of strong intermolecular forces, the molecules of solids are tightly packed and only oscillate around their mean positions. Its properties are:

Because of weak intermolecular forces, the molecules in a liquid are tightly packed.
These forces are weaker in solids but stronger in gases.
Liquid molecules have a lot of space between them, which allows them to flow easily.
Liquids have a fixed volume and can easily take on the shape of a vessel.Gases

Gases are remarkable in that they appear to have no structure at all. They have neither a definite size nor a definite shape, whereas ordinary solids have both a definite size and a definite shape, and liquids have a definite size, or volume, even though their shape adapts to that of the container in which they are placed. 


Gases will completely fill any closed container; their properties are determined by the volume of the container rather than its shape. Its properties are:

The distances between molecules are large in this state of matter.
The intermolecular forces that exist between them are insignificant.
As a result, translatory, rotatory, and vibratory motions are prominent in gases.
Gases have no fixed shape or volume.Plasma
Plasma is a type of matter that is not commonly seen. Plasma is made up of particles with a very high kinetic energy. Electricity is used to ionise noble gases, resulting in glowing signs that are essentially plasma. Stars are superheated forms of plasma. Measurement Uncertainty . In Chemistry, students often deal with experimental data and theoretical calculations. Most of the data is present in an extremely large number of quantum. This uncertainty in measurement is the range of possible values within which the true/real value of the measurement exists. There are practical ways to handle these figures with convenience and present the given data as realistically as possible.

Scientific Notation
As discussed above, atoms and molecules have very low masses and are present in exceedingly large numbers. We are here dealing with numbers as large as 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the molecules of just 2 g of H2 hydrogen gas and as small as 0.00000000000000000000000166 g which is the mass of a hydrogen atom. On a similar scale exist the values of constants such as the speed of light, Planck’s constant, electric charge of particles, etc.

Thus, when handling numbers involving such scales of zeroes, it becomes extremely difficult for simple calculations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To solve these issues, scientists have developed a scientific notation for such numbers. Scientific Notation here is the exponential notation in which one can represent a given number in the form of N × 10n, where N is a digit term that ranges between 1.000… and 9.999…, and n is an exponent of positive or negative values. Accordingly, one can write 2702.0109 as 2.7020109 × 103 in scientific notation. It can be observed that once shifted the decimal point three places to the left and thus added the exponent (3) of 10 to the scientific notation. Similarly, write 0.00001008565 as 1.008565 ×  10-5. Here, the decimal point is moved to the right by five places as the (-5) exponent of 10 is in the scientific notation.   Laws of Chemical Combination .What is Law of Chemical Combination
A collection of laws that governs the interaction; such as how they combined to form other matter, of matter with each other, is combinedly called the Laws of Chemical Combinations. The law of chemical combination collection includes five laws, which are as follows:

Laws of Conservation of Mass
Laws of Definite Proportions
Laws of Multiple Proportions
Gay-Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes
Avogadro’s Law. Law of Conservation of Mass

Law of Conservation of Mass states that “Mass can neither be created nor can be destroyed in a chemical reaction” but it can be transformed from one form to another. 
Example of Law of Conservation of Mass
For an example of conservation of mass, let’s consider the formation of a water molecule from oxygen and hydrogen molecules. Balance chemical Reaction of formation of water is:


2H2     +     O2  ? 2H2O
Law of Definite Proportions

Law of Definite Proportions which is also known as the Law of Constant Composition, states that in any given chemical compound the composition of the element by mass is always remains the same. Law of Multiple Proportions

According to the Law of Multiple Proportions, If two elements combined to form more than one compound under different circumstances, then the ratio of the masses for one element when second mass is fixed for all different compounds is always a small whole number.Example of Law of Multiple Proportions
Carbon and oxygen combine to form two distinct compounds (under different circumstances). The first is the most common gas, CO2 (Carbon dioxide), and the second is CO (Carbon monoxide). Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes

Gay Lussac enacted this law based on his observations in 1808. This law states that “when gases are produced or combined in a chemical reaction, they do so in a simple volume ratio provided that all the gases are at the same temperature and pressure.”


This law is regarded as an of definite proportions for gases and the difference between these two chemical combination laws is that Gay Lussac’s Law is stated the ratio of volume, whereas the law of definite proportions is stated in terms of mass. Avogadro’s Law

According to Avogadro’s Law, an ‘equal volume of all gases contains the equal number of molecules under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. Dalton’s Atomic Theory . In the year 1808, the English scientist and chemist John Dalton proposed Dalton’s atomic hypothesis, a scientific theory on the nature of matter. It asserted that all matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny, indivisible units. According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all substances are made up of atoms, which are indestructible and indivisible building blocks. While the atoms of one element were all the same size and mass, other elements had atoms of different sizes and weights. What is Atomic Theory?
Atomic theory is a fundamental concept in science that describes matter as composed of discrete units called atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of an element that maintain the chemical properties of that element. They consist of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in various orbits. This theory explains the behavior of atoms in chemical reactions, where they rearrange to form new substances without being destroyed or fundamentally altered. Initially proposed by John Dalton in the early 19th century, atomic theory has evolved to incorporate the discovery of subatomic particles and the principles of quantum mechanics, profoundly impacting our understanding of chemistry and physics. Postulates of Dalton’s Atomic Theory 
The postulates of Dalton’s theory may be stated as follows:

All matter is composed of atoms, which are indivisible: According to Dalton, the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite proportions can be explained using the idea of atoms. He proposed that all matter is made of tiny indivisible particles called atoms, which he imagined as “solid and movable particles”
All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties: Dalton proposed that every single atom of a particular element, such as copper, potassium etc, is the same as every other atom of that particular element. e.g. A potassium atom is different from an oxygen atom. Elements may share some similar boiling points, melting points, but no two elements have the same exact same set of properties.
Compounds are combinations of two or more different types of atoms: In the third part of Dalton’s atomic theory, he proposed that compounds are combinations of two or more different types of atoms. An example of such a compound is Common Salt. Common Salt is a combination of two different types of elements with varying physical and chemical properties. The first, sodium, is a highly reactive metal. The second, chlorine, is a toxic gas. When they react, the atoms combine in a 1:1 ratio to form white crystals of NaCl.
A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms: In the last postulate, Dalton suggested that chemical reactions neither destroy and nor create atoms. They just rearranged the atoms. Using our salt example again, when sodium combines with chlorine to make salt, both the sodium and chlorine atoms still exist. They simply rearrange to form a new compound. Advantages of Dalton’s Atomic Theory:
Dalton’s theory provides a basic idea to differentiate between elements and compounds.
Dalton’s atomic theory. doesn’t violate the law of multiple proportions, the law of conservation of mass, and the law of constant proportions.
Disadvantages of Dalton’s Atomic Theory:
Dalton states that atoms are indivisible that they can be further divided into electron, proton and neutron.
Dalton states that atoms of a given element have exactly the same masses. But, it is known that even atoms of the same element can have different masses just like isotopes.
Dalton states that atoms of different elements can have different masses. But, it is known that even atoms of different element can have same masses just like isobars.  Limitations of Dalton’s Atomic Theory
Subatomic Particles: Dalton’s atomic theory posited that atoms were indivisible. This has been disproven with the discovery of subatomic particles—protons, electrons, and neutrons—which make up atoms.
Isotopes: Dalton believed all atoms of a given element were identical in mass and properties. However, isotopes, which are variants of elements with different atomic masses, contradict this idea. Examples include hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, each having different numbers of neutrons.
Isobars: Dalton’s theory also claimed that atoms of different elements would have different masses. Yet, isobars, atoms of different elements that share the same mass number (such as 40Ar and 40Ca), demonstrate this is not necessarily true.
Combination Ratios: Dalton suggested that elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds. However, many complex organic compounds, like sugar (C11H22O11), do not conform to simple stoichiometric ratios.
Allotropes: The theory does not explain allotropes—different forms of the same element with distinct properties, such as carbon manifesting as both diamond and graphite. Gram Atomic and Gram Molecular Mass.   Avogadro’s number is critical to understanding the structure of molecules as well as their interactions and combinations. e.g. because one atom of oxygen will combine with two atoms of hydrogen to form one molecule of water (H2O), one mole of oxygen (6.022 × 1023 of O atoms) will mix with two moles of hydrogen (2 × 6.022 × 1023 of H atoms) to form one mole of H2O. Another feature of Avogadro’s number is that the mass of one mole of material equals the molecular weight of that substance. Water, for example, has a mean molecular weight of 18.015 a.m.u. implying that one mole of water weighs 18.015 grams. Many chemical computations are made easier by this feature. 

Now let’s discuss some important concepts before understanding the gram atomic mass and gram molecular mass.

Atomic Mass: Atomic mass is the mass of an atom of the given element. The unit of atomic mass is a.m.u. often denoted as u. One atomic mass unit (a.m.u.) is said to be exactly equal to the 1/12 the ratio of the mass of 1 mole of C-12 atoms to Avogadro’s Constant (NA).
Molecular Mass: Molecular Mass is the sum of the mass of the atoms present in a molecule of the given substance. Its unit is also a.m.u. e.g. the molecular mass of NH3 = 14 + 1 × 3 = 17 a.m.u.
Molar Mass: The mass of the 1 mole of a given substance is known as molar mass. The SI unit of molar mass is kg/mol however g/mol is the usually used unit. Molar mass can also be defined as the molecular mass of the given substance expressed in grams. e.g. 2 a.m.u. is the molecular mass of hydrogen gas therefore as per the definition the molar mass of hydrogen gas will be 2 g.
Mole Concept: It is a concept revolving around 12 g of C-12 isotope containing atoms equal to Avogadro’s Constant. Mole is actually an amount. The amount can be of atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, fruits, or books but our scope would be limited to chemical entities. What we actually do is calculate the mass of chemical entities in terms of mole. The value of Avogadro’s Constant i.e. the value of 1 mole of a substance is 6.0221367 × 1023.
Mole: One mole is defined as the amount of the substance which contains as many entities as there are atoms in 12 g of C-12 isotope. As measured by mass spectrometer the mass of one atom of C-12 atom is found to be 1.992648 × 10-23 g. Since 1 mole of C-12 atoms is 12g. Therefore, the number of atoms present in 1 mole = 12g / 1.992648*10-23 g atom-1 or 6.0221367 × 1023 atoms. The value of 1 mole is known as Avogadro’s Constant. The term ‘Avogadro’s Constant’ is termed after the great pioneer Amedeo Avogadro. It is denoted by the symbol NA. Gram Atomic Mass

Gram atomic mass is the periodic table element’s atomic weight in grams. The molar mass of an element is the mass of one mole in grams. The mass of one mole of an element is defined as its gram atomic mass.  It is calculated by taking an element’s atomic weight from the periodic table and converting it to grams. Thus, when the mass of an element is expressed in grams then it is known as gram atomic mass. For example, the gram atomic mass of helium is 4 g. Similarly, sodium (Na) has an atomic weight of 22.99 u and a gram atomic mass of 22.99 grams. So one mole of sodium atoms weighs 22.99 g. This implies that the quantity of the element of the given substance when weighs equal to its gram atomic mass is called one gram atom. 

The gram atomic mass of a material is the amount of that substance in grams that is numerically equivalent to its atomic mass. If we wish to write a substance’s gram atomic mass, we first write its atomic mass, then subtract the atomic mass unit u and add grams to the numerical value of the atomic mass. That is,

Mass of the element (in g) = Number of gram atoms / Atomic mass of the element (in g).  Gram Molecular Mass
The mass in grams of one mole of a molecular material is known as the gram molecular mass. The molar mass and gram molecular mass are the same things. The main distinction is that gram molecular mass defines the mass unit. The gram molecular mass (g/mol) can be expressed in grams or grams per mole (g/mol). 


How to find the Gram Molecular Mass?



To determine the mass, use the molecular formula.

Look up each element’s relative atomic mass in the formula.

Multiply the subscript following each element symbol (the number of atoms) by the atomic mass of that element. If there is no subscript, it implies that the molecule contains only one atom of that element.

To get the gram molecular mass, add all of the numbers together.

The mass of one molecule of material in grams should not be confused with the mass of one molecule of the substance in grams. The real mass or molecular mass of a material is the mass of one molecule.Gram Molecular Mass

Mole concept is known as the method used to express the amount of substance. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of different entities (such as atoms, ions, and molecules) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure 12C weighing precisely 12 g. Even a gram of any pure element contains a high amount of atoms. The mole connects a simple macroscopic feature (bulk mass) to a genuinely significant fundamental trait (number of atoms, molecules, etc.). One mole is also defined as the amount of a substance that contains as many entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of the 12C isotope. It was found that the mass of one atom of carbon-12 element is equal to 1.992648 × 10-23 g as measured by the mass spectrometer. Since one mole of Carbon-12 atom weighs 12 g, therefore, the number of atoms in it equals 12 g mol-1 / 1.992648 × 1023 g atom-1 = 6.0221367 × 1023 atoms mol-1. The following formula may be used to calculate the number of moles of a chemical in a given pure sample:


n = N/NA .  Avogadro’s Number (NA)
Avogadro’s number is 6.0221367 × 1023. It is named Avogadro’s constant or number in honor of Amedeo Avogadro, a great pioneer in this field. It is denoted by NA. We can also say that 1 mole is the collection of 6.0221367 × 1023 units of a substance. Here, the substance is atoms, molecules, or ions. The number of units that make up a mole has been established empirically to be 6.0221367 × 1023. This is known as the fundamental constant, also known as Avogadro’s number (NA) or the Avogadro constant. This constant is appropriately stated in chemistry using an explicit unit termed per mole. No matter what the given substance may be, one mole of it is always equal to NA. Mole Concept Formulas
Mole concept is a method where we identify the mass of chemical substances as per requirement. The entire mole concept revolves around 12 g (0.012 kg) of the 12C isotope. In the SI system, the unit of the fundamental quantity ‘the amount of substance’ is the mole. The symbol of the mole is “mol”. Below are the quantities related to the mole concept:  Atomic Mass and Molecular Mass
Atomic mass of an element is the mass of its one atom. The unit of atomic mass is a.m.u. The atomic mass is roughly the sum of protons and neutrons present in the atom. One atomic mass unit (a.m.u.) is said to be exactly equal to one-twelfth the mass of one carbon-12 atom. Therefore, the value of one a.m.u. is 1 g / NA = 1.66056 × 10-24 g. In the present era, the atomic mass unit is known as a unified mass unit. Hence, a.m.u. has been replaced by u.  What is Molar Mass?
Molar mass is defined as the total mass of one mole of the substance. It is frequently expressed in terms of ‘grams per mole’ (g/mol). The SI unit for this amount, however, is kg/mol. The following formula may be used to calculate molar mass:


Molar mass of a Substance = (Mass of the substance in grams)/(Number of Moles) . Gram Atomic Mass and Gram Molecular Mass
Gram atomic mass is the mass of one mole of an atom. Gram molecular mass is the mass of one mole of a molecular substance expressed in grams. It is also known as molar mass. It is also defined as the mass of one mole of molecules. This is the difference between gram atomic and gram molecular mass. This amount of a substance is also called one gram molecule.  How to Find Gram Molecular Mass?
A substance’s gram molecular mass is its molecular mass measured in grams. e.g., the molecular mass of O2 is 32 grams; this is the relative molecular mass given in grams. Remember that relative atomic mass is always expressed as a ratio and has no units. 

Gram Molecular Volume
The volume occupied by one gram mole of a substance in a vapor state or gaseous state at STP is called as gram molecular volume. The standard temperature to obtain GMV is 273K, and the standard pressure is 1 atm. The ideal gas equation is utilized to get gram molar volume (GMV = 22.4L).

Relative Molecular Mass (RMM)
Relative molecular mass is the molecular weight of an element or molecule; it is expressed as RMM. It is the number of times a single molecule of a substance remains heavier than one-twelfth the mass of a carbon atom (12C). What is Percentage Composition?

The percentage composition of any given compound is defined as the ratio of the amount of each element to the total amount of all individual elements that are available in the given compound and then multiplied by 100. 


In this, we measure the quantity of the elements in terms of grams which is present in the solution. This calculation is mostly used in the chemical analysis of the compound.

Formula Percentage Composition 
We can express the percentage composition of a given element using the formula below:


%CE = (gE/gT)×100


where 


% CE is the percentage composition of element E. 
gE is the total amount of element E present in the compound T.
gT is the total amount of all the elements present in the compound T. Mass Percentage (w/w)%
To describe the concentration of an element in a compound or a component in a combination, we utilize the idea of mass percentage composition. The total percent by mass of each element contained in a compound is denoted by this term.


It’s important to note that the mass percentage composition can be calculated by dividing the mass of a component by the total mass of the combination. After that, multiply the ratio by 100. The mass percent (w/w)% is another name for it.
Stoichiometry and Stoichiometric Calculations.  Jeremias Richter, a German chemist, was the first to create or discover the word Stoichiometry. The quantitative analysis of the reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction is known as chemical stoichiometry. The name “stoichiometry” comes from the Greek words “stoikhein” (element) and “metron” (measure). We will study what it implies and discuss the various components of this topic further below.

What Is Stoichiometry?
The calculation of products and reactants in a chemical reaction is known as stoichiometry.  It is a key concept in chemistry that allows us to compute reactant and product amounts using balanced chemical equations. The balanced equation’s ratios are used in this case. In general, all reactions are influenced by one fundamental factor which is the amount of substance present.


Stoichiometry is the measurement of the products and reactants in any chemical reaction. The term “stoichiometry” is derived from two Greek words: “stoichion,” which refers to element determination, and “metry,” which refers to measurement.
What is the Stoichiometric Coefficient?
The number of molecules involved in a process is known as the stoichiometric coefficient or stoichiometric number. When you look at a balanced reaction, you’ll see that both sides of the equation have the same amount of elements. The number in front of atoms, molecules, or ions is known as the stoichiometric coefficient. Fractions and whole numbers can both be used as stoichiometric coefficients. The coefficients essentially assist us in determining the mole ratio between reactants and products. Both sides of the equation have the same amount of components in a balanced reaction. The stoichiometric coefficient is the number written in front of atoms, ions, and molecules in a chemical reaction to balance the number of each element on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. While fractions can be used as stoichiometric coefficients, whole numbers are more commonly utilized and preferred. Since they establish the mole ratio between reactants and products, these stoichiometric coefficients are useful. The Stoichiometric coefficient is the number of molecules of a reactant that participate in a reaction.


Consider the following equation:


aA + bB ? cC + dD


The Stoichiometric coefficients of the A, B, C, and D, respectively, are a, b, c, and d in this equation. Stoichiometry in Chemical Analysis
Chemists frequently utilize stoichiometric calculations, which follow a quantitative analysis approach, to quantify the amounts of chemicals present in a sample. There are two primary forms of analysis. We’ll go over them in more detail later.

Gravimetric Calculation-In analytical chemistry, gravimetric analysis refers to the quantitative determination of analyte based on the mass of the solid. The gravimetric analysis produces the most precise results of any other analytical method since a substance’s weight can be measured with more precision than other fundamental quantities.

The following are several types of gravimetric analysis.


Precipitation gravimetry – It entails isolating an ion in solution by a precipitation reaction, filtering, washing the precipitate to remove impurities, and finally weighing and measuring the precipitate’s mass by difference.
Volatilization gravimetry – The process of separating components of a mixture by heating or chemically decomposing the sample is known as volatilization gravimetry.
Electrogravimetry – It comprises the electrochemical reduction of metal ions at the cathode as well as the deposition of ions on the cathode at the same time. The mass of analyte initially present in the sample is determined by weighing the cathode before and after electrolysis, and the weight difference corresponds to the mass of analyte initially present in the sample. Volumetric Analysis- Volumetric analysis is the process of quantifying a substance in terms of volume. In volumetric analysis, a known volume (V1) of a material whose concentration (N1) is known reacts with an unknown volume (V2) of a solution of a substance whose concentration (N2) must be predicted. At the end of the response, the volume, V1, is recorded. The following equation is used to compute the N2 concentration.
N2 x V2 = N1 x V1",0,1,0,0,0
36,Structure of Atom,"Composition of an Atom. Atom is the smallest unit into which matter can be divided without the release of electrically charged particles. It is also the smallest unit of matter that has the characteristic properties of a chemical element. As such, the atom is the basic building block of matter. Atoms are extremely small, that they can’t be seen through naked eyes or a normal microscope. Most of the space in an atom is empty. The rest consists of a positively charged nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The nucleus is small and dense compared with the electrons, which are the lightest charged particles in nature. Electrons are attracted to any positive charge by their electric force. In an atom, electric forces bind the electrons to the nucleus.


Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons. More than 99.94 % of an atom’s mass is in the nucleus.
Variation in the number of Protons, Electrons and Neutrons in different atoms
The atom of each element differs in the number of electrons, protons and neutrons. As we move ahead in the periodic table, the atomic number increases. And similarly the number of protons, neutrons, electrons also increases and accordingly size increases.

Electron: The electron is a subatomic particle, whose electric charge is negative one elementary charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. 

Proton: A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol p or p?, with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and a mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are jointly referred to as “nucleons”.

Neutron: The neutron is the particle in the atomic nucleus with a mass = 1 and charge = 0. Neutrons are found together with protons in the atomic nucleus. The number of neutrons in an atom determines its isotope.

Although a neutron has a net neutral electrical charge, it does consist of charged components that cancel each other out with respect to charge.


There can be mainly three types of changes in element:


When the number of protons in an atom is changed, you will change the atom from one element to a different element.
If you change the number of electrons in an atom, you will get an ion of the element.
If the numbers of neutrons are changed without changing the number of protons and electrons, then isotopes are formed. The difference in the number of neutrons between the various isotopes of an element means that the various isotopes have different masses.. Atomic structure is the structure of an atom that consists of a nucleus at the center containing neutrons and protons, while electrons revolve around the nucleus. Atoms are made up of a very tiny, positively charged nucleus that is surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.

The earliest concept of atoms was given by Indian philosopher Maharshi Kanad who proposed that matter is made up of microscopic indestructible particles called ‘Parmanu’. A Greek philosopher named Democritus also initially claimed that matter is formed of atoms, and is credited with developing the concepts of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. Later in the 1800s, John Dalton a British Scientist put out the first atomic structure scientific theory.

This article explores the concept of atomic structure in detail, including the atomic models, and the concept of quantum theory.  What is Atomic Structure?
The composition of an element’s nucleus and how its electrons are arranged around it are referred to as the element’s atomic structure. Protons, electrons, and neutrons comprise the majority of the atomic structure of matter.

The atom’s nucleus, which is made up of protons and neutrons, is surrounded by the atom’s electrons. The element’s atomic number expresses the total number of protons in an element’s nucleus. Protons and electrons are equal in number in neutral atoms. But atoms can receive or lose electrons to make them more stable, and the resulting charged object is known as an ion. Because different elements’ atoms contain varying numbers of protons and electrons, their atomic structures are also different. This explains why different elements have unique properties.

Atomic Structure Definition

The atomic structure refers to the composition and organization of atoms, the basic units of matter. At the center of an atom is the nucleus, which contains protons (positively charged particles) and neutrons (neutral particles)
 The atomic model which we study today was not given at one time. Several attempts were made by scientists and later improved leading to the current atomic model. Let’s learn about different atomic models which led to the evolution of the present model.

Atomic Models
Many scientists used atomic models to understand the structure of the atom in the early centuries. Each of these models had advantages and disadvantages of its own and played a significant role in the development of the modern atomic model. Scientists like John Dalton, J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, and Niels Bohr made the most noteworthy contributions to science.

This section of the article discusses the following theories regarding atomic structure:

Dalton’s Atomic Theory
Thomson’s Atomic Model
Rutherford’s Atomic Model
Bohr’s Atomic Model
Quantum Mechanical Model
Dalton’s Atomic Theory
John Dalton, a British Chemist proposed that every matter is made up of atoms. These atoms are indivisible and indestructible i.e. they can’t be broken down into smaller particles. He also suggested that all atoms of a particular matter are the same, but atoms of different elements differ in size and mass. This means atoms of each element are unique.


According to Dalton’s atomic theory, Chemical reactions occur at atomic level and involve the rearrangements of atoms in order to form the products. According to the postulates proposed in his theory, atomic structure is made up of atoms and they are the smallest particles responsible for chemical reactions to occur.
Postulates of Dalton’s  Atomic Theory

Every matter that exists is made of atoms.
Atoms are indivisible.
A particular element has only one type of atom in it.
Atoms of different elements differ in size and mass.
An atom has a constant mass that varies for every element.
During a chemical reaction, atoms undergo rearrangement.
Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another.Demerits of Dalton’s Atomic Theory

This theory was not able to explain the existence of isotopes and isobars.
No appropriate explanation was provided regarding the structure of atoms.
Later the atoms were found to be divisible, and Dalton’s claim of atoms being indivisible was proved to be wrong.Thomson’s Atomic Model
Sir Joseph John Thomson was also an English chemist famous for his discovery of electrons known as Thomson’s Atomic Model, for which he also got the Nobel Prize. He conducted a cathode ray experiment to invent electrons. He proposed that atoms are like a sphere of positive charge with negative charge embedded in them. He named this atomic model as Plum Pudding Model. Rutherford Atomic Model
Rutherford who was a student of J. J. Thomson discovered Nucleus which contained protons and neutrons inside it. This discovery made huge changes to the atomic structure. The observations made by Thomson in his experiment were used by Rutherford to propose his theory for atomic structure through an experiment called Rutherford’s Alpha Ray Scattering Experiment. Alpha Ray Scattering Experiment
Rutherford used the radioactivity phenomenon in conducting his experiment. He used the radioactive material radium bromide (RaBr). RaBr emits ? particles which is a form of radiation. A thin gold metal sheet was put up in the setup. Then the alpha ‘?’ particles were bombarded on this sheet. The ? particle has a charge of +2. To observe the deflection of the particles a screen of Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) was used and placed behind the Gold foil. Rutherford further developed a detector in order to count the number of radioactive particles. Initially, he recorded the count rate of RaBr as he kept a count of ? particles emitted per minute.Bohr’s Atomic Model
Neils Bohr, a student of Rutherford proposed his model in 1915 to address the limitation of Rutherford’s Atomic Model. It is the most widely used atomic model and is based on Planck’s theory of quantization. It explains that electrons always move in fixed orbitals only, and they are not present everywhere in the atom. Bohr also explained that each orbit has a fixed energy level. An orbit is also called an Energy Shell. Rutherford only explained the nucleus of the atom while Bohr made changes to that model and added electrons and energy levels.Quantum Mechanical Model of Atom
Quantum Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion and kinematics of microscopic objects. Since atoms are of below microscopic size and the limitations of Bohr’s Atomic Model motivated the scientists to give a more general and accurate atomic model based on Quantum Theory. The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom basically uses two following theories to explain the structure of the atom:

Dual Behaviour of Matter
Heisenberg Uncertainty PrincipleDual Behaviour of Matter
Dual Behaviour of Matter was proposed by French physicist de-Broglie. He stated that every matter irrespective of its size exhibits both wave-like properties and particle-like properties. He meant to say that just like a photon has both wavelength and momentum similarly an electron will have both wavelength(?) and momentum(p).  He called these waves Matter Waves. The relation between wavelength and momentum is given by


 ? = h/p 


where, 


? is Wavelength
p is Momentum
h is Planck’s Constant. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle states that when a microscopic particle is in motion it is impossible to find the exact position and momentum of the particle simultaneously. He meant that at a time we can find either position or momentum i.e. if the exact position is known then momentum is uncertain and vice-versa. It is represented as 


 ?x.?p ? h/4?


where,


?x is Uncertainty in Position
?p is Uncertainty in Momentum
h is Planck’s Constant. Schrodinger Wave Equation
Schrodinger Wave Equation gives the equation for the total energy of the system (an atom or a molecule) whose energy doesn’t change with time i.e. there is no loss or gain of energy. Mathematically, Schrodinger Wave Equation is represented as 


H? = E?


where 


H is Hamiltonian Operator in Mathematics
E is the Total Energy of the System
? is a Wave function. Quantum Number
To describe the location of an electron inside an atom we need a set of 4 numbers known as Quantum Numbers. These Quantum Number helps in distinguishing different orbitals which contain electron. Orbitals that have a smaller number mean they are closer to the nucleus, have a smaller size, and have a larger probability of finding an electron. The four types of Quantum Numbers are listed below:

Principal Quantum Number
Azimuthal Quantum Number
Magnetic Quantum Number
Spin Quantum Number
Principal Quantum Number(n)
It is represented by ‘n’. It gives the idea of a shell in which an electron is present and also about its energy. A lower value of ‘n’ means the shell is closer to the nucleus and has lower energy. It is given by n = 1,2,3…     Developments Leading to Bohr’s Model of Atom. Neils Bohr, a scientist, expanded on Rutherford’s model of the atom through his experiments. The dual nature of electromagnetic radiation was an important element in the development of Bohr’s model. This indicates that radiations can have both wave-like and particle-like properties. Let’s take a closer look at the evolution that led to Bohr’s model of an atom.

Wave Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation
When electrically charged particles travel under acceleration, alternating magnetic and electrical fields are formed and communicated, according to James Maxwell’s 1870 proposal. These fields are transferred in the form of waves and are referred to as electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation. For many years, scientists have pondered the nature of light as a sort of radiation. Initially, scientists assumed that light was made up of particles called corpuscles. The wave nature of light was only discovered in the early nineteenth century. Maxwell was the first to demonstrate, using the notion of electromagnetic radiation, that electricity, magnetism, and light are all various manifestations of the same phenomena.

Properties of Electromagnetic Wave Motion

Oscillating charged particles generate perpendicular oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These fields are also perpendicular to the wave’s propagation direction.
Electromagnetic waves, unlike sound or water waves, do not require a medium to propagate. They have the ability to travel across a vacuum.
There are many distinct types of electromagnetic radiations available today, each with a different wavelength or frequency. They are all part of an electromagnetic spectrum. The names and applications of the various parts of this spectrum vary. For example, the Infrared region around 1013 Hz is utilised for heating, and the UV component of the sun’s rays is at 1016 Hz. Visible light is the little component around 1015 Hz, which our eyes can only see. Non-visible light detection necessitates the use of specialised equipment.
Electromagnetic Radiation Properties
Frequency (v) – The number of waves passing through a specific place in one second. Hertz (Hz, s-1) is the SI unit named after Heinrich Hertz.
Wavelength (?) – Wavelength is measured in the same units as length, which is the meter (m). However, because electromagnetic radiation is made up of multiple waves of small wavelengths, we utilise smaller units.
Wavenumber: The number of wavelengths per unit length is referred to as the wavenumber. Its units are m-1 which are the inverse of wavelength.
The speed of light (c): It is the rate at which all types of electromagnetic radiation, regardless of wavelength, travel in a vacuum (3.0 x 108 ms-1). The equation: relates the wavelength, frequency, and speed of light.
c = ? ?.Particle Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation and Black-body Radiation

Although the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation explains phenomena such as “diffraction” and “interference,” certain crucial properties remain unknown. The following observations are unexplained:
The nature of radiation emission from heated bodies is referred to as black-body radiation.
The photoelectric effect, or the emission of electrons from a metal surface when exposed to radiation.
The heat capacity of solids varies.
Atomic line spectra with reference to hydrogen.Planck’s Quantum Theory and Explanation for Black-Body Radiation
The phenomena of black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect are not well explained by classical physics or the wave theory of light. Max Planck provided the first solid explanation for the phenomenon of black-body radiation in 1900. He proposed that atoms or molecules emit or absorb energy only in discrete amounts known as quantum amounts, rather than in a continuous fashion. The smallest amount of energy emitted or received in the form of electromagnetic radiation is referred to as a quantum.

Photoelectric Effect
Einstein used Planck’s quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect in 1905. According to Planck’s quantum theory, firing a light beam on a metal surface is equivalent to shooting a beam of particles or photons at the metal. In this situation, when a sufficiently energetic photon collides with an electron in the metal, the photon quickly transmits its energy to the electron, and the electron is ejected without any time lag. A more intense light beam has a greater number of photons and hence ejects a greater number of electrons. Finally, the kinetic energy of the expelled electron increases as the energy carried by a photon increases. The kinetic energy of the expelled electron is thus proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Bohr’s Model of the Hydrogen Atom.The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was the first atomic model to successfully explain the atomic hydrogen radiation spectra. Niels Bohr proposed the atomic Hydrogen model in 1913. The Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom attempts to fill in some of the gaps left by Rutherford’s model. It has a special place in history because it introduced the quantum theory, which gave rise to quantum mechanics.Planetary Model of the Atom
Quantum mechanics first appeared in the mid-1920s. One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Neil Bohr, was interested in a hotly debated topic at the time – the structure of the atom. Numerous atomic models had emerged, including J.J. Thompson’s theory and Ernest Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus. However, Bohr supported the planetary model, which stated that electrons revolved around a positively charged nucleus in the same way that planets revolved around the sun.

Bohr model of hydrogen atom postulates

An atom, such as a hydrogen atom, has numerous stable circular orbitals in which an electron can remain.
An electron remains in a specific orbit in which no energy is emitted or absorbed.
When an electron may jump from one orbit to another with more energy absorption but from one orbit to another with lower energy emission.
An electron’s angular momentum in an orbit is an integral multiple of h/2?. This integral multiple is known as the hydrogen atom’s primary quantum energy level. As a result, mvr = nh/2?, where m = electron mass, v = electron tangential velocity, and r = radius of Bohr energy levels.
Atomic line spectra
Another example of quantization is atomic line spectra. When an element or ion is heated by a flame or excited by an electric current, the excited atoms emit light of a specific color. The emitted light can be refracted by a prism, resulting in spectra with a distinct striped appearance due to the emission of specific wavelengths of light. The wavelengths of some emission lines could even be fitted to mathematical equations in the relatively simple case of the hydrogen atom. The equations, however, did not explain why the hydrogen atom emitted those specific wavelengths of light. Prior to Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom, scientists were baffled as to why atomic emission spectra were quantized.

Bohr’s Equation
The Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom proposed the planetary model first, but an assumption about electrons was later made. The assumption was that the structure of atoms could be quantized. Bohr proposed that electrons orbited the nucleus in fixed-radius orbits or shells. Only shells with the radius specified by the equation below were permitted, and electrons could not exist between these shells. The equation gives the mathematical expression for the allowed value of the atomic radius.

r(n) = n2 × r(1)

Where n is a positive integer and r(1) is the smallest radius allowed for the hydrogen atom, also known as the Bohr’s radius. The radius of Bohr has the value: 

r(1) = 0.529 × 10-10 m. Limitations of the Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom:

It violates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle by treating electrons as having a known radius and orbit.
The Bohr Model calculates the ground state orbital angular momentum incorrectly.
It predicts the spectra of bigger atoms incorrectly.
The relative intensities of spectral lines are not predicted.
Fine and hyperfine structures in spectral lines are not explained by the Bohr Model.
It does not account for the Zeeman Effect.Improvements to the Bohr Model

The Sommerfeld model, sometimes known as the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, was the most notable improvement to the Bohr model. Electrons in this scenario travel in elliptical orbits around the nucleus rather than circular orbits. The Sommerfeld model explained atomic spectral effects better, such as the Stark effect in spectral line splitting. The model, however, was unable to handle the magnetic quantum number. In 1925, the Bohr model and models based on it were supplanted by Wolfgang Pauli’s quantum mechanics-based model. That model was modified to produce the present model, which Erwin Schrodinger introduced in 1926. Today, wave mechanics is used to describing atomic orbitals in order to understand the behavior of the hydrogen atom.

Discovery since Bohr’s hydrogen model
The Bohr model did an excellent job of explaining the hydrogen atom and other single-electron systems like He+. Unfortunately, when applied to the spectra of more complex atoms, it did not perform as well. Furthermore, the Bohr model provided no explanation for why some lines are more intense than others or why some spectral lines split into multiple lines in the presence of a magnetic field.Spectrum of the Hydrogen Atom. Electrons in a hydrogen atom circle around a nucleus. Because of the electromagnetic force between the proton and electron, electrons go through numerous quantum states. Neil Bohr’s model helps in visualizing these quantum states as electrons orbit the nucleus in different directions.



When Electrons in an atom are supplied energy, they get excited and jump from a lower energy level to a higher energy level. As we know electrons always try to remain in their lowest energy level, the excited electrons go back to their original level and emit radiation in this process. This phenomenon explains the emission spectrum via hydrogen, sometimes known as a hydrogen emission spectrum.

37,Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties,"Classification of Elements .Periodic categorization of elements is a way of grouping elements based on their characteristics, such as keeping elements that are similar in one group and the rest of the elements in the other. The elements are grouped in the long-form periodic table in order of their atomic numbers. The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus of its atom. The long-form periodic table has the following characteristics:
The long-form periodic table has 18 vertical columns and 18 groups in total.
Beginning on the left, these groups are numbered 1 through 18.
In a long-form periodic table, there are seven horizontal rows known as periods. In the long-form periodic table, this results in seven periods.
The main group elements are those found in Groups 1, 2, and 13–17. These elements are also referred to as a typical, representative, or normal elements.
The elements of Groups 3 to 12 are called transition elements.  Classification of Elements 
The classification of elements is the grouping of elements with comparable qualities. Even though each element is unique, there are some commonalities between them. Scientists were finally successful in categorising the various elements into groups or chemical families based on these similarities, allowing comparable elements to be grouped together and dissimilar elements to be separated after showing a group. The periodic table is formed as a result of the classification of elements. The s, p, d, and f-blocks divide the long version of the periodic table into four sections.

Elements of the s-block
The last electron in the valence s-sub-shell of the outermost energy shell is filled in the elements in the s-block of the periodic table. This block has just two groups since the s-subshell can only have two electrons (1, 2). Alkali metals are elements that belong to group 1 and have an ns1 electrical configuration. Similarly, alkaline earth metals having an ns2 electrical structure are found in group 2. As a result, s-block elements are group 1 and 2 elements, such as hydrogen and helium, in which the s-orbitals are gradually filled in.


The general electronic configuration of s-block elements is ns1-2 (where n = 2 – 7).Elements of the p-block
The last electron in a P-block element enters one of the three p-orbitals of the corresponding outermost shell. There are six groups in this block because the p-subshell can only hold six electrons (13 to 18). Representative elements are the elements in the periodic table that belong to the s and p-block.


General electronic configuration of p-block elements is ns2  np1-6 (where n = 2 – 7).
Elements of the d-block
Elements in which the last electron enters any one of the five d-orbitals of their respective penultimate shells are called d-block elements. The d-block is organised into 10 vertical columns or groups numbered 3 to 12 since the d-subshell can only have five orbitals and ten electrons. Because their ground state has incompletely filled d-orbitals, the d-block elements are known as transition elements.


General electronic configuration of p-block elements is (n–1)d1 – 10ns0–2 (where n = 4 – 7).


Elements of the f-block
D-block elements are those in which the final electron enters one of the seven f-orbitals of their respective ante-penultimate shells. All of the f-block elements are divided into two series, each with fourteen elements: in the first series, electrons are filled in the 4f-subshell, which is known as the lanthanide series (atomic number 5871); in the second series, electrons are filled in the 4f-subshell, which is known as the lanthanide series. The filling takes place in the 5f-subshell in the second series, which is known as the actinide series.

General electronic configuration of p- block elements is (n-2)f0 – 14(n-1)d0 – 2ns2 (where n = 6 – 7).

Newland’s Law of Octaves
In 1864, a British chemist named John Newlands sought to combine the 62 elements known at the time. He arranged them in ascending order based on their atomic weights and discovered that every eighth element had the same properties. As a result of this discovery, Newland’s law of octaves was born. The law of octaves asserts that when the elements are arranged in ascending order of their atomic masses, every eighth element has similar properties. The elements having equivalent properties according to Newland’s law of octaves are depicted below.


The components’ proximity to musical octaves, in which every eighth note is comparable to the first, was contrasted by Newlands. This was the first time each element was given an atomic number. However, in the scientific community, this method of classifying elements was met with scepticism. While the properties of the eighth element are similar to those of the first, they are ordered in increasing order of their atomic masses.
Limitations of Newland’s Law of Octaves
Newland’s law of octaves has the following main faults.

Some elements were placed together in Newland’s periodic classification. For example, cobalt and nickel were placed in the same slot.
Distinctive element qualities were grouped together. Metals like cobalt, nickel, and platinum, for example, were classed alongside halogens.. Advantages of  Newland Law of Octaves
Some of the advantages of Newlands’ Octaves law are as follows:
This law creates a framework for grouping objects with similar characteristics.
The Act provided the government with broad powers to compile all known data into a tabular format.
The law of octave, developed by Newlands, was the first to rationally based on atomic weight, relating the properties of elements to their atomic masses.
This approach performed considerably better for the lighter sections. For example, lithium, sodium, and potassium were combined. Every eighth element has the same qualities as the first. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic mass.Periodic Classification of Elements refers to the arrangement of elements on the basis of the periodic repetition of their properties. It means the elements which exhibit similar properties on a regular interval are placed in the same group.

In this article, we will learn about, History of the Classification of Elements, various ways to classify elements, their drawbacks, and others in detail in this article.

Classification of Elements
Elements are the basic units that make up all matter in our surroundings. Earlier, only 31 chemical elements were discovered in 1800. Around 63 new elements were discovered in 1865. This necessitated the periodic classification of elements as it was difficult to remember the properties of each element. Hence, if we put all the alike elements in the same group we can predict the properties of each element of that group. There are presently 118 elements that we are aware of.

History of Classification of Elements
The Periodic Table which we learn today is not the result of a single effort. There have been several attempts in the past to classify elements, however, few got succeed and even these tables had some drawbacks and hence were revised by new classifications. Hence, the Modern Periodic table evolved over the period. Some of the successful attempts to classify elements are listed below:

Dobernier Triad
Newland Law of Octaves
Lother Meyer Arrangement
Mendleeves Periodic Table
Modern Periodic Table
Dobernier Triad
In 1829, Dobernier attempted the first-ever classification of elements. He placed 3 elements in a group and stated that the mass of the middle element is equal to the arithmetic mean of the other two elements. He made 3 such groups. Drawbacks of Dobernier’s Triad
The drawbacks of the Dobernier’s Triads are discussed below,


Dobernier could only form three such triads out of 30 elements that were known at that time.
Dobernier Triad was not applicable to very low or very high atomic mass elements
In the case of F, Cl, and Br, the rule of arithmetic mean is not valid, although F, Cl, and Br are placed in the same order in the modern periodic table. Newland Law of Octaves
Newland, a British Chemist made an attempt in 1865 to arrange atoms in increasing order of their atomic mass. He stated that when atoms are arranged on the basis of increasing order of the mass then every eighth element exhibits similar properties. This arrangement was based on his understanding of musical notes where the word repeats after every 7th interval. It is similar to Indian Musical Note Sa, Re, Ga, Ma…..  Drawbacks of Newland Law of Octaves
The drawbacks of the Newland Law of Octaves are discussed below,


It was applicable only to Calcium. After Calcium, every eighth element didn’t resemble the properties. 
Dissimilar elements were placed in the same group while similar atoms were placed in different groups. For Example, Iron was placed with Oxygen and Sulphur.
Some groups contain two elements in one place. For Example, Co & Ni. Mendleeve’s Periodic Table
Mendeleev in the same year 1869 unknown of the Lother Meyer’s arrangement gave the most successful and detailed periodic table. He stated that “The properties of elements whether physical or chemical are periodic functions of their atomic masses”. Based on his law he arranged all the attempts known at that time in a table called the Periodic Table, which later on became the basis of the arrangement of elements for the Modern Periodic Table. He called the vertical column ‘Groups’ and horizontal rows ‘Periods’.

Features of Mendeleeve’s Periodic Table
Important features of Mendeleeve’s Periodic Table are listed below:


It was the most simplified arrangement of elements based on their properties. One can easily guess the property of elements placed in a particular group.
He corrected the atomic masses of elements such as Beryllium, Gold, Indium, etc.
He left vacant positions for some elements that were not known at that time but he predicted such elements would exist in the future. He added the prefix ‘eka’ to those elements. For Example, Eka Aluminium was Gallium, Eka-Silicon was Germanium.Drawbacks of Mendeleeve’s Periodic Table
Following are the drawbacks of Mendeleeve’s Defect
The position of Hydrogen was not defined. Hydrogen resembles properties with that of alkali metals as well as halogens but was placed in the group of alkali metals. He couldn’t explain why hydrogen will not be in the halogen group although both are nonmetals.
There exists anomalous pair in the table which would not follow the law of increasing atomic weight. For Example, Argon (39.9 u) was placed before K (39.1) and Co was placed before Ni.
Since the table was based on increasing order of atomic mass but the position of isotopes was not defined as isotopes have different masses.
The position of Lanthanoids and Actinoids was not assigned separately.Modern Periodic Table
Modern Periodic Table is a long-form periodic classification of elements based on the electronic configuration of elements. Modern Periodic Table has vertical columns called ‘Groups’ and horizontal rows called ‘Periods’. There are 18 Groups and 7 Periods in Modern Periodic Table. The Modern Periodic Table was given by Henry Mosley in 1913.Features of Modern Periodic Table
The following are the properties of the Modern Periodic Table:


It is based on the atomic number of elements rather than atomic mass.
Since it is based on atomic numbers hence it solved the problem of the position of isotopes.
It allows systematic classification of Elements on the basis of s, p, d, and f on the basis of the subshell in which the last electron enters.
In Modern Periodic Table Metals are on Left Hand Side while Non-Metals are on Left Hand Side. The two sides are connected by d-block elements also known as transition elements
The elements which formed anomalous pairs in Mendeleeve’s Periodic Table got their justified position in this table as the classification is based on atomic number rather than atomic mass.
Lanthanoid and Actinoids were placed in the table separately at the bottom.Drawbacks of Modern Periodic Table
Although Modern Periodic Table solves all the issues of Mendeleeve’s classification yet it has some drawbacks:


The position of Hydrogen is still not settled as Hydrogen resembles properties of both halogen and Alkali Metals.
Lanthanoids and Actinoids are placed separately at the bottom and are not part of main table. Classification of the Elements in the Periodic Table
The elements in the periodic table can be classified in four ways based on their electronic configurations:

Noble gas elements: Noble gases are elements in the modern periodic table’s group 18. The electronic configuration of this group’s first element (helium) is 1s2. The rest of the elements (neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) have an ns2 np6 outer shell electronic configuration. Since the octet of these elements is complete, they are extremely stable.
Representative elements: S-block and p-block elements are examples of representative elements. The elements in groups 1 and 2 are referred to as s – block elements (elements with 1s2 and 2s2 outermost configuration). Groups 13-17 are known as the p-block elements (outermost configuration varies from ns2 np1 to ns2 np5).
Transition elements: Transition elements are elements that belong to groups 3 to 12 and have an outer shell electronic configuration of (n-1)d1-10 ns1-2. These elements are also referred to as d-block elements.Modern Periodic Law. All matter in our environment is made up of basic units known as elements. Initially, only 31 chemical elements were discovered in 1800 and it was easier to study their chemical and other properties. However, as more and more elements were discovered due to technological advancements in science, it became harder to study all the elements simultaneously. Scientists began to think about a method to simplify the study of elements in order to make their work easier.Significance of the Periodic Classification of Elements
The classification of elements into groups provides us with a fixed pattern in which the elements’ properties change on a regular basis. The periodic table simplified and organized the study of elements’ physical and chemical properties. We can now simply go to the group and see the properties of the periodic table elements or predict the properties of an element if we know the properties of other elements in the same group.
Despite the fact that so many elements have already been discovered, there is still a chance that new elements will be discovered. Scientists can use a periodic table to learn about the trending characteristics of elements based on their properties, and thus distinguish new elements from existing ones. Furthermore, researchers are constantly striving to discover new elements and investigate their properties. What is Modern Periodic Law?
Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, observed a pattern among the elements: as their atomic masses increased, their chemical and physical properties repeated with prior elements. He named this property Mendeleev’s Periodic Law. However, this law was not accurate for all elements, as only 63 were known at the time.

In an effort to improve upon Mendeleev’s Periodic Law, Henry Moseley proposed the Modern Periodic Law, which states that 


“The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.” 
Moseley Law
Modern periodic law is sometimes also called Moseley Law as it was given by Henry Moseley hence the name Moseley law, which states that,


“Various properties of the chemical elements whether Physical or Chemical are periodic functions of its  atomic mass.” Mendeleev Periodic Table
Dimitri Mendeleev arranged all the known elements to him in the order of increasing atomic mass and saw the periodic pattern in their properties. As there were only 63 elements known to Mendeleev and some of the smaller nucleus atoms are also not discovered yet, he left some gaps in the table so that the other elements can be collected with their similar property elements. Modern Periodic Table
The Modern Periodic Table, also known as the long form of the Periodic Table, is a continuation of Mendeleev’s work. However, in the Modern Periodic Table, Neil Bohr used the atomic number of elements as the basis for periodicity. Bohr divided all the elements into 18 groups, labelled 1 to 18, and 7 periods, named 1 to 7. The groups are made up of elements that have atoms with similar outer shell electronic configurations, while the periods are made up of elements with the same number of shells in total.
Classification of the Elements in the Modern Periodic Table
We classify elements in the periodic table in rows, columns, and blocks that are discussed below,

In Peiods and Groups
Elements are classified into 7 periods and 18 groups where elements in each group are placed using the electrons in their outermost shell and elements in each period are placed using the number of shells of each element.

The number of elements in each period:


First period has 2 elements.
Second period has 8 elements.
Third period has 8 elements.
Fourth period has 18 elements.
Ffifth period has 18 elements.
Sixth period has 32 elements.
Seventh period has the rest of the elements.

In Blocks
The Modern Periodic Table is divided into four blocks that are as follows:

s-Block
p-Block
d-Block
f-Block
Now let’s learn about each block in brief.

s-Block Elements
Groups 1 and 2 are included in the s-Block as elements these blocks have their valence electron in the s-orbital. Also, these groups are also called alkali and alkali-earth metals respectively and their electronic configuration is ns1 and ns2 for group 1 and group 2 elements, where n is the period of that element.

p-Block Elements
Group 13 to Group 18 are included in the p-Block as elements in these blocks have their electronic configuration like ns2np1-6. Some of the most useful elements to mankind are found in this block such as Carbon, Silicon, Aluminium, Phosphorus, Sulfur, etc.

Learn more about, p-block

d-Block Elements
All the elements from group 3 to group 12 are collectively called d-Block elements. These elements are also called transition elements or transition metals as these elements show unstable transitional behaviour between s and p block elements.

f-Block Elements
Only Lanthanide and Actinide series are part of the f-Block. These are called inner transition elements and mark their presence between the elements lanthanum and hafnium and between actinium and rutherfordium.  Electron Configuration

The representation of electrons distributed in atomic shells of an element is known as electronic configuration. The electrons are mathematically located in these subshells and the notations help in locating the position of these electrons as well as the electronic configuration. 
Notation of Electron Configurations
Notation is the representation of the number of electrons present in the subshell. It is written with the shell number, name of the subshell, and a total number of electrons present in the subshell in superscript. Distribution of Electrons in Atomic Orbits
The planetary model of an atom was created by Neils Bohr. He was the first to indicate that the properties of the elements have a regular pattern. The electronic structure of an atom is based on the “Bohr atomic model.” He was the first to describe the arrangement of electrons in distinct orbits/shells (electronic configuration). He proposed that electrons are spread in electronic shells that are circular in shape (orbits). These electrons travel a defined distance around the nucleus in orbits. 

Before understanding the concept of Electronic Configuration, let’s first understand some basic terms used with it as mentioned below:

Shells
It is based on the principal quantum number (n)  which determines the maximum number of electrons that can be placed in a shell. The number of electrons in each shell is given by the formula 2n2 where n represents the shell number.

Subshells
It is based on an azimuthal quantum number which is widely denoted by ‘I’.  At the same time, the azimuthal quantum number depends on the value of the principal quantum number (n). For example, if the value of shell n=3. The subshells corresponding to it will be s,p, and d with I=0, I=1, and I=2. These are the shells in which the actual distribution of electrons takes place. And the maximum number of electrons accommodated by a sub-shell is given by the formula 2(2I+1).Filling of Atomic Orbitals
How atomic orbital are filled with electrons? the answer to this is very important to find the electron configuration of various atoms various rules which help in filling of atomic orbital are,

Aufbau Principle
The principle states that the electrons will occupy the orbits with lower energy and then the orbits with higher energy levels. The principle gets its name from the Greek word “Aufbeen” which means building up.  Pauli Exclusion Principle
The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that a maximum of two electrons can fit into an orbit with opposite spins. It is based on the concept that if two electrons carry equal azimuthal numbers then they will have opposite spins in the orbit.

Hund’s Rule
The rule states that every orbit is initially occupied by a single electron before a second electron fills the orbit. It’s the rule that determines the order of electrons in the sub-shell. Writing Electron Configurations
So, before drawing an electronic configuration we need to extract some information from the periodic table like the atomic number, no. of electrons, shells, etc. Looking through an example let’s understand the writing method of an electronic configuration. The potassium element has atomic number 19. And has 19 electrons which will be placed in s and p sub-shell. 

The electronic configuration can be written as 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1. Its 19 electrons can be divided into different shells in a manner,

K shell (n=1)= 2,
L shell (n=2) =8,
M shell (n=3)=8, and
N shell (n=4)=1. Electronic Configuration of Elements
Electronic configuration represents the way in which electrons are filled inside the orbital of any atom. Electronic configuration of various elements are,

Electronic Configuration of Copper
Atomic Number of Copper is 29 and its electronic configuration is,

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6  3d10 4s1

or

[Ar]3d10 4s1

Electronic Configuration of Chromium
Atomic Number of Chromium is 24 and its electronic configuration is,

or

[Ar]3d5 4s1

Electronic Configuration of Oxygen
Atomic Number of Oxygen is 8 and its electronic configuration is,

1s2 2s2 2p4

or

[He]2p4 . Electronic Configuration of Nobel Gases
Ideal gas are chemical elements that have completed valance shells and they generally do not participate in the bonding process. Ideal gas includes Helium, Neon, and others.

Following are the electronic configuration of some ideal gases,

Helium (He): Helium has 2 electrons and its electronic configuration is1s2

S-block elements are those elements in which the last electron is present in the s-orbital. In the periodic table. They reside in the first 2 columns. S-block consists of 14 elements that include, Hydrogen (H), Lithium (Li), Helium (He), Sodium (Na), Beryllium (Be), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Rubidium (Rb), Calcium (Ca), Caesium (Cs), Strontium (Sr), Francium (Fr), Barium (Ba), and Radium (Ra).What are s-block Elements?
You all are well-familiar with the concept of the modern periodic table. In the modern periodic table, we learn about 4 kinds of blocks i.e. s-block, p-block, d-block & f-block. Here, we will learn the definition of s-block elements. It is the most intriguing block of the periodic table.


The element which enters in the outermost s-orbital are known as s-block elements. 


S-block elements consists 2 groups i.e. Group 1 & Group 2. Group 1 consists elements which are called as alkali metals while Group 2 consists metals which are called as alkaline earth metals.

Group 1- Alkali Metals
Group 2- Alkaline Earth Metals. What are Alkali Metals of Group 1?
Have you ever wondered why sodium causes a fizzy explosion when it is dropped in water? We will uncover this further.

Group 1 elements are called alkali metals because they make hydroxides, whenever reacts with water. You all know that water is strongly alkaline. Here you got your answer for the above question.
Alkali metals are well-known for their extreme reactions & their easy bond with other elements. The elements of Group 1 have 1 valence electron in their outermost s-orbital.What are Alkaline Earth Metals of Group 2?
During any occasion, you buy fireworks right? And when you light them up, they starts glowing & gives a beautiful view. It’s the magic of none other than our magnesium.
Group 2 introduces us the alkaline earth metals which exists in the earth’s crust. The interesting thing here is that their oxides & hydroxides are alkaline in nature. The elements of Group 2 have 2 valence electrons in their outermost s-orbital.Properties of s-block Elements
The S-block elements possesses distinct properties. In this section, you’ll learn about the properties of s-block elements. Their properties mainly categorized into 2 parts:

Physical Properties
Chemical Properties. Physical Properties of s-block Elements
Let’s dive deep into the properties of s-block elements

Melting Point: S-block elements consists different melting points. The Group 1 elements i.e. Alkali metals have low melting point. For example, Sodium can be melted around 98° celsius. When we talk about Group 2 elements i.e. Alkaline Earth Metals, they have high melting point. For example, Calcium needs 842° celsius temperature to melt which is 9 times more than sodium needs.
Conductivity: Due to the presence of electrons that are loosely bound, these electrons can easily move through the metallic structure. This encourages the flow of electricity. That’s why s-block elements have higher electrical conductivity.
Nature of Bonds: In S-block, the Group 1 elements i.e. Alkali metals always form ionic bonds as these elements have low ionization enthalpies that decreases downwards to the group. In simple words, as we move down the group, the ionic characteristic increases.
Density: The densities of s-block elements is relatively low due to their large size.
Photoelectric effect: The s-block elements shows photoelectric effect. They emit electrons from their surface, when they come into the contact of light. Lithium is an exception here because of its higher ionization enthalpy.
Chemical Properties of s-block Elements
Now, it’s time to learn about the chemical properties of S-block elements:

Reactivity: S-block elements are highly reactive in nature. Group 1 elements especially Na and K are well-known for their high reactivity with water that results in producing hydrogen gas & hydroxides. Group 2 metals are less reactive as compared to Group 1 elements but still they show a notable reactivity when exposed to air or water.
Formation of Compounds: S-block elements have high tendency to make compounds. They donate their electrons to form ionic compounds. Group 1 elements donate 1 valence electron while Group 2 elements donate 2 valence electrons to form a compound.
Reducing Agents: Due to the strong tendency of loosing electrons, s-block elements are known as strong reducing agents. Atomic Mass of s-block Elements
Atomic mass is the total mass of the protons & neutrons in an atom of the element. It is denoted by atomic mass per unit i.e. a.m.u or g/mol.
Atomic mass of S-block elements refers to the average mass of the atoms of a particular element, taking into account the various isotopes and their relative abundances in nature.
Atomic masses of the s-block elements changes as we go down the groups. The number of protons & neutrons increases and that’s why the atomic mass also increases.Diagonal Relationship of s-Block Elements
Diagonal relationship is the relationship which shows a similar behavior between certain elements. These elements are located diagonally across each other within the same group but different periods of a periodic table.Some of the similarities observed in these diagonal relationships include:

Similar Ionic radii– Certain elements have remarkably similar ionic sizes. For example, Lithium (Li) and Magnesium (Mg} & Beryllium (Be) and Aluminum (Al).
Common chemical behavior– Diagonal elements show similarity in their chemical reactions. For example, Lithium (Li) and Magnesium (Mg} & Beryllium (Be) and Aluminum (Al).
Complex formation– Due to their anonymous charge densities and electronic configurations, diagonal elements form similar kind of complexes. For example, Lithium (Li) and Magnesium (Mg}.
Oxidation state– Diagonal elements tend to show similar oxidation state in some cases. For example, Beryllium (Be) and Aluminum (Al).Periodic Trends in s-Block Elements
S-block elements show several kind of periodic trends. As you move down to the group:

Atomic size of the elements increases due to the addition of electron shells.
Metallic character of the s-block elements follows a certain pattern from left to right. The elements on left like Alkali metals easily lose electrons and shows strong metallic properties. While the elements on right like halogens and noble gases have more non-metallic traits. This happens due to the decreasing atomic sizes.
As you move down the group, the reactivity of s-block elements increases due to the increase in their atomic sizes.
Due to the increasing atomic size & shielding effect, the s-block elements need less energy to remove electrons which results in the decline of ionization energy.
Compounds of s-block Elements
Here are preparations & properties of some important compounds of S-block elements:

Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
Preparation: Sodium hydroxide is generally prepared through the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride or via the reaction of sodium carbonate with calcium hydroxide.
Properties: It is a white solid with high solubility in water and form a strongly alkaline solution. It is a strong base which is used in various industries such paper production, detergents, and in the chemical industry.
Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3)
Preparation: Calcium carbonate is naturally occured and can be obtained from limestone, chalk, or marble. It’s also prepared through precipitation reaction by mixing calcium chloride & sodium carbonate.
Properties: It is a white, odorless powder with a variety of applications such as cement production, diet supplement, plastic manufacturing and as a filler in paints and coatings.What is Periodic Table?
A periodic Table is the arrangement of all the elements in the known universe based on either atomic weight or atomic number. There are various failed attempts to arrange the known elements so that all the elements with similar properties are arranged together. But in 1863 Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, gave Mendeleev’s Periodic Table which is the most successful attempt of that time. In modern-day, scientists using Mendeleev’s Periodic Table as a base created a long-form periodic table which is called Modern Periodic Table. Metallic Character of The Elements  
The metallic property of elements reduces as we move left to right across a period in the periodic table. The metallic property of elements grows as we progress up the periodic table from top to bottom.

Non – Metallic Character of The Elements  
The nonmetallic property of elements grows as we move left to right across a period in the periodic table. The non-metallic nature of a group of periodic table elements reduces as we proceed from top to bottom. Melting Point
The melting point is the total amount of energy necessary to convert a solid into a liquid. If the link between the atoms of elements is strong, it takes a lot of energy to break the bond. It gets smaller as we go from top to bottom. Non-metals, on the other hand, rise from top to bottom of the periodic table. Among metals, carbon has a high melting point. Boron has a high melting point when compared to other semi-metals. Tungsten has a high melting point when compared to other metals.",0,1,0,0,0
38, Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure,"What is Chemical Bonding?
Chemical bonding is the formation of a chemical bond between two or more atoms, molecules, or ions that results in the formation of a chemical compound. These chemical bonds are what hold the atoms in the resulting compound together.


Chemical bonding is the attractive force that holds various constituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together and stabilizes them through the overall loss of energy. As a result, chemical compounds are dependent on the strength of the chemical bonds between their constituents; the stronger the bonding between the constituents, the more stable the resulting compound.
Theories on Chemical Bonding
There are two important theories on chemical bonding, and those are:

Lewis’s Theory of Chemical Bonding
Kossel’s Theory of Chemical Bonding. Lewis Theory of Chemical Bonding
The Lewis theory of chemical bonding, also known as the Lewis electron dot theory, was proposed by the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916. It provides a simple model to understand how atoms bond together to form molecules by focusing on the arrangement of valence electrons.

According to the Lewis theory, atoms gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of noble gases. Noble gases have complete outer electron shells, making them highly stable and unreactive. Lewis recognized that other atoms tend to react in ways that allow them to acquire a similar electron configuration.

Key points of Lewis’s Theory of Chemical Bonding are as follows:


An atom is made up of two parts: a positively charged Kernel (the nucleus plus the inner electrons) and an outer shell that contains electrons.
The outmost shell can only hold a maximum of eight electrons.
The outer shell’s eight electrons occupy the four corners of a cube that surrounds the ‘Kernel.’
Atoms with an octet configuration, i.e., 8 electrons in the outermost shell, represent a stable configuration.
In general, an element’s valency is equal to the number of dots in the corresponding Lewis symbol or 8 minus the number of dots (or valence electrons).
Atoms with eight electrons in their outer shell are said to have a stable configuration. Atoms with fewer than eight electrons in their outer shell will try to gain electrons to achieve a stable configuration. Atoms with more than eight electrons in their outer shell will try to lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration.
Chemical bonds are formed when atoms share, gain, or lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration. 

The number of dots in a Lewis symbol represents the number of valence electrons in an atom. 

The valency of an atom is the number of valence electrons that an atom can share, gain, or lose to achieve a stable configuration.
Kossel’s Theory of Chemical Bonding
Kossel’s theory of chemical bonding, also known as the electron transfer theory, was proposed by the German physicist Walther Kossel in the early 20th century. Kossel noticed that the highly electronegative halogens and the highly electropositive alkali metals are separated by noble gases and his theory focuses on the transfer of electrons between atoms as the basis for chemical bonding, particularly in ionic compounds. Koss el’s theory builds upon the concept of the octet rule and the key points of Kessel’s Theory of Chemical Bonding are as follows:
Electron Transfer: Kossel proposed that atoms form bonds by the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another. This transfer occurs between an atom with low ionization energy (tends to lose electrons) and an atom with a high electron affinity (tends to gain electrons). The result is the formation of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions that are held together by electrostatic forces.
Ionic Bonding: Kossel’s theory emphasizes ionic bonding as the primary type of bonding in many compounds. It suggests that when an atom loses or gains electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, it becomes an ion. The positively charged cations and negatively charged anions then attract each other, forming an ionic bond. This bonding occurs between metals and nonmetals.
Stability of Noble Gas Configuration: Kossel’s theory focuses on achieving a stable electron configuration similar to noble gases. By transferring or sharing electrons, atoms strive to attain a complete outer electron shell with eight valence electrons, except for hydrogen and helium, which can achieve stability with two valence electrons.Fajan’s Rule
Fajan’s rule is postulated by Kazimierz Fajans in 1923. Fajans’ rule determines whether a chemical bond is covalent or ionic. He was able to predict ionic or covalent bonding at the time using X-ray crystallography and attributes such as ionic and atomic radius. The key points of Fajan’s rule are as follows:
Polarizing Power: Fajan’s rule states that cations with a higher charge or smaller size have greater polarizing power. A cation with a higher charge density, resulting from a higher charge or smaller size, can pull the shared electrons in a bond closer to itself, creating a more polar bond.
Polarizability: Fajan’s rule also considers the concept of polarizability, which refers to the ease with which the electron cloud of an atom or ion can be distorted. An anion with a larger size and more diffuse electron cloud is more easily polarized.
Ionic Character: According to Fajan’s rule, a chemical bond between a cation and an anion with high polarizing power and high polarizability respectively exhibits a greater degree of ionic character. In other words, the electrons in the bond are more localized towards the cation, creating a polar covalent or even an ionic bond.
Covalent Character: Conversely, a bond between species with low polarizing power and low polarizability tends to have a more covalent character. The electrons in the bond are more evenly shared between the atoms, resulting in a less polar or even nonpolar bond.Types of Chemical Bonds
The strength and properties of the chemical bonds formed vary. There are four primary types of chemical bonds that atoms or molecules form to form compounds. Chemical bonds of this type are-

Ionic Bonds
Covalent Bonds
Hydrogen Bonds
Polar Bonds
Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds are formed by the loss and gain of electrons. The atom which loses electrons is called a cation and is positively Charged while the atom which gains electrons is called an anion and is negatively charged. The Ionic bond is formed due to the electrostatic interaction between the cation and anion. Example – NaCl

Covalent Bonds
Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons. These types of bonds are formed when the atoms are not loose or gain electrons and hence they share their electrons with each other. The electrons of each atom revolve in the atom’s orbit as well as other atoms’ orbit with which the bond is formed.

Hydrogen Bonds
Hydrogen Bonds are formed between the H and F or O or N atoms of another molecule. This is an intermolecular bond. For Example, in water, within an H2O molecule, the hydrogens are attached to Oxygen with a covalent bond while the Hydrogen of the molecule bond with the O of another H2O molecule with a hydrogen bond.

Polar Bonds
Polar Bonds are a type of covalent bond formed between two atoms due to the unequal distribution of electrons in the bond. The more electronegative atom attracts the shared pair of electrons within itself forming a slightly negative charge on the electronegative element and partially positive on the other bonded atom.Ionic Bond . Ionic Bond is a bond that is formed by the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms. In an ionic bond, a complete transfer of electrons takes place in the process of bond formation. This bond is formed by the attracting force between the cations and the anions that are formed by the donating and acceptance of the electrons.

Ionic Bond is also called the Electrovalent bond and is formed to complete the octet of the participating atoms. If an atom combines after forming a bond it releases some energy called the bond formation energy. The higher the energy released the higher the stability of the compound.

In this article, we will learn about bonds, the nature of the bond, Ionic bonds, examples of ionic bonds, and others in detail.
Chemical Bond
The chemical bonds are formed when two or more two atoms transfer or share their electrons and combined completely to complete their octet. All the compounds around us are formed by the bonds.  Now we define a bond as the force of attraction that joins two or more atoms together to form chemical compounds. We have about 120 elements known in the periodic table but there are billions of compounds known to us all these are formed by the joining of various elements together through bonds. There are generally three types of bonds that are,
Ionic Bonds: They are formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.
Covalent Bonds: They are formed by sharing of the electrons.
Coordinate Bonds: They are formed when an atom donates its lone pair of electrons to another atom.What is Ionic Bond?
The bond formed by losing or gaining electrons is called Ionic Bond. All the atoms form bonds to complete their octet or to achieve an inert gas configuration. An atom that has eight electrons in its outermost shell is called an inert gas which is highly stable and does not react with other atoms. If an atom has 1,2 or 3 electrons in its outermost shell it losses its electrons to form a cation with eight electrons in its penultimate shell, whereas if an atom has 5, 6, or 7 electrons in its outermost shell its accepts electrons forming an anion with eight electrons in its outermost (valance) shell. So the bond formed between these cations and the anion because of the electrostatic attraction force is called the Ionic bond.
The ionic bond is the strongest bond and all the compounds that are formed by the ionic bond are called the ionic compound. The ionic bond is also called an electrovalent bond as they are formed by the transfer of electrons. So simply an ionic or electrovalent bond is defined as the bond formed by the transfer and acceptance of the electrons. High electropositive elements like alkali and alkaline earth metals and high electronegative elements like halogens are combined easily by ionic bonds.

Electrovalent Bond
Ionic Bonds sometimes called Electrovalent bonds and they are also formed when electrons are transferred from one atom to another atom, resulting in positive and negative ions. The bond formed by the transfer of electrons between atoms is known as an electrovalent bond or an ionic bond. Electrovalent bonds can only be formed between a metal and a nonmetal. Two non-metals or two metals can neither form an electrovalent bond.

Factors Responsible for the Formation of Ionic Bonds. Various factors responsible for the formation of the ionic bond are discussed below,


The metal atom taken for the formation of the ionic bond should have low ionization enthalpy.
The non-metal atom taken for the formation of the ionic bond should have high electron gain enthalpy.
High energy must be released when the formation of the bond takes place, the higher the energy released the higher the strength of the ionic bond.Electronegativity and Ionic Bonding
An ionic bond is a stable bond formed by the complete transfer of valence electrons. Ionic bond results in the formation of two oppositely charged ions – positive ions called cations and negative ions called anions. High electronegative compound forms very stable ionic compound as they can easily accept an electron to form anions. The ionic bond of highly electropositive and highly electronegative elements are much more stable as compared to other ionic compounds as they have a strong electrostatic force of attraction between them.

Properties of Ionic Bond 
Ionic bonds have various properties that differentiate them from other bonds and some of the properties of the ionic compound are,


Ionic bonds are the most stable of all bonds.
As ionic bonds have charge separation, they are the most reactive of all the bonds in the appropriate medium.
The melting and boiling points of ionic-bonded molecules are extremely high.
Ionic-bonded molecules in aqueous solutions or molten states are good conductors of electricity because of the presence of ions, which act as charge carriers.
In nature, ionic-boned compounds are usually in a solid state.
Ionic-bonded molecules exist as crystal structures. What is a Bond?

Covalent bonds are classified into two types: sigma bonds and pi bonds. The number of shared bonds varies depending on the number of electrons. When two, four, or six electrons are shared, the number of bonds formed is one, two, or three, depending on the number of electrons shared. Covalent bonds are thus classified as sigma bonds or pi bonds based on the type of overlapping.


Types of Bonds:

Sigma Bond: End-to-end (head-on) overlap of bonding orbitals along the internuclear axis creates this type of covalent bond. This is known as head-on or axial overlap. This can be formed by any of the atomic orbital combinations listed below.
s-s Overlapping: In this scenario, two half-filled s-orbitals are overlapping along the internuclear axis. This type of overlapping can be seen in the creation of the H2 molecule.
s-p Overlapping: Along the internuclear axis, there is an overlap of one atom’s half-filled s orbital and another atom’s half-filled p orbital. The formation of methane, ammonia, and water exhibits this type of overlapping.
p-p Overlapping: This type of overlapping occurs along the internuclear axis between one half-filled p orbital and another half-filled p orbital. This type of overlapping can be seen when fluorine atoms combine to form F2 molecules.
Pi (?) Bond: During the creation of Pi bonds, atomic orbitals overlap in such a way that their axes remain parallel to each other and perpendicular to the internuclear axis. Atomic orbitals overlap sideways during bond formation, forming a saucer-shaped charged cloud above and below the internuclear axis.Strength of Sigma and Pi Bond
The extent to which atomic orbitals overlap determines the strength of a bond.
The sigma bond, which overlaps along the internuclear axis, is more powerful than the pi bond, which overlaps sideways.
Pi bonds have a smaller area of overlap than sigma bonds. This is why the pi-bond breaks first, followed by the sigma bond.
During multiple bond formation, a pi bond is formed in addition to a sigma bond.
Bond Parameters
In order to become stable, various atoms must join together. This combination occurs as a result of the formation of bonds. Ionic or electrovalent bonds, covalent bonds, and coordinate bonds are the three types of bonds. As a result, every bond has a characteristic linked with it


Bond parameters are a set of different features or characteristics that may be observed in bonds. 


The parameters that define a covalent bond are as follows:

Bond Order
Bond Angle
Bond Length
Bond Enthalpy or Energy
Bond Order

A covalent bond’s bond order is the total number of covalently bonded electron pairs between two atoms in a molecule. It can be calculated by drawing the molecule’s Lewis structure and counting the total number of electron pairs between the atoms in question. For example, the carbon-hydrogen bond in C2H2 (ethyne/acetylene) has a bond order of 1 and the carbon-carbon bond has a bond order of 3. The oxygen-oxygen bond in an O2 molecule has a bond order of 2. The carbon-oxygen bond in a carbon monoxide molecule has a bond order of 3.

Single bonds have a bond order of 1.
Double bonds have a bond order of 2.
Triple bonds have a bond order of 3.

Bond Order according to the Molecular Orbital Theory: The bond order of a covalent bond, according to molecular orbital theory, is equal to half of the difference between the number of bonding and antibonding electrons, as represented by the following formula:


Bond Order = (½) × (Total number of bonding electrons – Total number of antibonding electrons)
Bond Angle

Bond angle is defined as the angle formed between two covalent bonds formed by the same atom. A bond angle is a geometric angle formed by any two adjacent covalent bonds. This bond parameter provides information about a compound’s molecular geometry.

Bond Length

The bond length of a molecule is the distance between the nuclei of two chemically bonded atoms. It is close to the sum of the covalent radii of the two bonded atoms. For covalent bonds, the bond length is inversely related to bond order; greater bond orders result in stronger bonds, which are accompanied by stronger attraction forces that hold the atoms together. These strong forces of attraction result in short bonds. Rotational spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction can all be used to determine this bond parameter experimentally. Bonded atoms absorb thermal energy from their surroundings and vibrate incessantly. The bond length varies as a result of this vibration. As a result, it is critical to understand that the bond length of a covalent bond represents the average distance between the nuclei of the atoms involved.


Periodic Trends in Bond Length: Bond lengths are proportional to the atomic radii of the atoms involved. The periodic trends that can be observed in element bond lengths are similar to the periodic trends that can be observed in element atomic radii (decreases across the period, increases down the group).


Bond Energy or Bond Enthalpy

Bond energy is a measurement of the strength of a chemical bond. It is defined as the amount of energy required to break all covalent bonds of a particular type in one mole of a chemical compound (which is in its gaseous state).


Factors Affecting Bond Energy


The amount of energy required to break a chemical bond is directly proportional to its strength. As a result, bond energy is:



Bond energies are inversely proportional to bond length, so longer bonds have lower bond energies.

Bond energies are directly proportional to bond order, implying that multiple bonds have high bond energies.

The atomic radii of the atoms involved in the bond are inversely proportional (since the atomic radius is directly proportional to bond length). What is VSEPR Theory?
VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion. As the name suggests this theory is used to find the shape of the molecule by taking into account the force of the electron pairs and lone pairs of the molecule. According to this theory, any molecule formed by sharing of electron pair between two or more atoms tends to take such shapes that minimize forces between the electron pairs or lone pairs of electrons. Postulates of VSEPR Theory
Various postulates of the VSEPR Theory are,

All the electron pairs in the molecule are arranged in such a way that they minimize the repulsion between the electron pairs of the atom.
The central atom of the polyatomic atom is the atom to which all the other atoms of the molecule are linked.
Valance Shell electrons of the molecule are responsible for the shape of the molecule.
The valence shell of the molecules is arranged in such a way that the distance between them is maximum and the repulsion between them is minimum.
If the central atom of the molecule is surrounded by bond pairs of electrons, then the asymmetrically shaped molecule is formed.
If the central atom of the molecule is surrounded by lone pairs and bond pairs of electrons, then the shape of the molecule so formed is distorted.
In each resonance state of the molecule, their structure is explained using the VSEPR theory.
The force of repulsion between the lone pairs, lone pair, and bond pair, and bond pairs follows the order.

Lone Pair – Lone Pair > Lone Pair – Bond Pair > Bond Pair – Bond Pair


Predicting Shapes of Molecules
We can easily predict the shape of the molecules using the VESPR theory using the following rules :

The least electronegative element of the molecule must be chosen as the central element. This atom can easily share its electron with other atoms of the molecule.
The lone pairs of the central atom are counted by taking the central atom’s outermost shell into account.
The electrons shared by other atoms with the central atom are accounted as the bond pair of electrons.
The lone pair and the pair are sums to find the VESP number of the molecule which is used to explain the shape of the molecule. Linear Shape of Molecule
The molecule in a linear shape is arranged in such a way that it has two valance shells and the bond pair in this arrangement are arranged in such a manner that their repulsion is minimum, this is achieved by taking the bond pair in opposite directions. Trigonal Planar Shape of Molecule
There are three molecules attached to the central atom in the Trigonal Planer molecule. The molecules in the trigonal planar structure are arranged in the form of an equilateral triangle which helps them to reduce the repulsion between the electron pairs of the atoms. Tetrahedral Shape of Molecule
There are four molecules attached to the central atom in the Tetrahedral molecule. The molecules in the tetrahedral structure are arranged in the form of a tetrahedron, which helps them to reduce the repulsion between the electron pairs of the atoms. Trigonal Bipyramid Shape of Molecule
There are five molecules attached to the central atom in the Trigonal Bipyramid molecule. The molecules in the trigonal bipyramid structure are arranged in the form of a triangular pyramid, which helps them to reduce the repulsion between the electron pairs of the atoms. Octahedral Shape of Molecule
In Octahedral shape, the central atom attaches 6 different atoms i.e. in total there are 6 bond pairs. These 6 bond pairs and the central atom arrange Octahedral to minimize electron repulsion.Pentagonal Bipyramidal Shape of Molecule
In Pentagonal Bipyramidal Shape, the central atom is attached to seven atoms at the corner to minimize the repulsion between the electron pairs. VSEPR Shapes of Molecules
We know that VSPER theory minimizes the force between the bond pair and lone pair electrons of atoms and the structure so formed also follows this rule. So using this theory we can easily predict the shape of the molecule if all the bond pairs and the lone pairs of the molecule are known to us.

The force of repulsion between Lone Pair- Lone Pair, Lone Pair- Bond Pair, Bond Pair- Bond Pair (BP – BP) is in the order mentioned below:


Lone Pair- Lone Pair (LP – LP) > Lone Pair- Bond Pair (LP – BP) > Bond Pair- Bond Pair (BP – BP). Now we can predict the shape of the molecule by first finding the total electron pairs around the central atom using the formula,


Total Electron Pairs =  ½ (Number of Valence Electrons of Central Atom + Number of atoms attached to Central Atom by single bonds). For Negative and Positive ions electron pairs are calculated as,

Negative Ions: In negative ions, we add the number of electrons equal to the units of negative charge on the ion to the valance electrons of the central atom.

Positive Ions: In positive ions, we subtract the number of electrons equal to the units of positive charge on the ion from the valance electrons of the central atom.Limitations of VSEPR Theory
The limitations of VESPR Theory are :

It fails to account for the different structures of isoelectronic species (i.e. elements having the same number of electrons). Why do these species having the same number of electrons, differ in their shapes?
It is unable to explain the formation of metal complexes.
The bent structure of halides is also not explained using the VESPR theory.Valence Bond Theory.Valence bond theory (VBT) describes the formation of covalent bonds and the electronic structure of molecules. It assumes that electrons occupy atomic orbitals of individual atoms within a molecule, and that the electrons of one atom are attracted to the nucleus of another atom.

VBT states that the overlap of incompletely filled atomic orbitals leads to the formation of a chemical bond between two atoms. The unpaired electrons are shared and a hybrid orbital is formed. VBT views bonds as weakly coupled orbitals (small overlap). When the orbitals overlap along an axis containing the nuclei, they form a ? bond. VBT accounts for the directional nature of covalent bonds.What is Valence Bond Theory?
Valance Bond Theory also called VBT is the basic theory used to explain the structure and the bonding in coordination compounds. This theory is used to explain the formation of the bonds in the various atomic orbitals of the coordination compounds.

Valance bond theory assumes that the bonds are formed by individual atoms by the donations of electrons. But this assumption is wrong as in reality the bonds in the coordination bond are formed by the delocalization of the electrons in the orbitals of the coordination compounds. Valance Bond Theory class 11 is the basic theory that helps us visualize how various bonds are formed in nature.What is Hybridization?
In the year 1931, scientist Linus Pauling proposed the innovative concept of hybridization. He called the process hybridization and characterized it as the shifting of the energy of particular atoms’ orbitals to produce new orbitals of equivalent energy. New orbitals, known as hybrid orbitals, emerge as a result of this process.Various types of hybridization are,

sp-Hybridization
One s and one p-orbital are combined together to generate two sp–hybrid orbitals with a linear structure and a bond angle of 180 degrees. For example, when BeCl2 is formed, the first atom is in the excited state 2s1 2p1, which is then hybridized to generate two sp–hybrid orbitals. BeCl2 is formed when these hybrid orbitals collide with the two p-orbitals of two chlorine atoms.

sp2–Hybridization
One s and one p-orbital are combined together to generate three sp2– hybrid orbitals with a planar triangular shape and a bond angle of 120 degrees.

sp3-Hybridization
One s and three p-orbitals are merged in this hybridization to generate four sp3– hybrid orbitals with a tetrahedral structure and a bond angle of 109 degrees 28?, or 109.5 degrees.What is Need for Valence Bond Theory?
Lewis’ theory explained the structure of molecules. It did not, however, explain the formation of chemical bonds. VSEPR theory, on the other hand, explained the shape of simple molecules. However, it had a very limited application. It also failed to explain the geometrical properties of complex molecules. As a result, scientists were forced to develop the theory of valence bonds in order to address and overcome these limitations.

Postulates of Valence Bond Theory
Various postulates of VBT or Valance Bond Theory are,

When two or more valance orbitals (half-filled) overlap each other they formed balanced orbital and then the electrons are filled in those orbitals accordingly.
Only unpaired electrons of the orbital participate in the filling of valance orbital. Paired electrons do not participate in the filling of valance orbital.
Covalent chemical bond formed by the valance atomic orbital are directional in nature.
Valance Bond formed are Sigma Bond and Pi Bond, if orbitals overlap head to head they form Sigma Bond, if the orbital overlap sidewise they form Pi bond.
Applications of Valence Bond Theory
Various applications of VBT or Valance Bond Theory class 11 and Valance Bond Theory class 12 are,

Valence Bond Theory explain the formation of covalent bond in various compounds.
The strength of various bonds of the compounds are explained by Valance Bond Theory (VBT), i.e. the strength of H2 and F2 are explain using Valance Bond Theory.
Limitations of Valence Bond Theory
The limitations of the Valance Bond Theory are,

Tetravalency of the carbon atom is not explained by the Valance Bond Theory (VBT)
Strong Ligand and Weak Ligand are not differentiate using Valance Bond Theory (VBT)
The localization of electrons are not explained using valance Bond Theory (VBT)
This theory fails to explain the colour exhibited by the coordination compounds. Valence Bond Theory Examples
Valence bond theory (VBT) is used to explain how covalent bonds form in many compounds. Here are some examples of VBT:

Water (H2O): Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bound to an oxygen atom. Each hydrogen atom has an s-orbital with one lone electron, and oxygen has an s-orbital with an electron pair.
Fluorine Molecule (F2): The F-F bond in the diatomic fluorine molecule is formed by the intersection of the two F atoms’ pz orbitals, each of which contains an unpaired electron.
Ethylene (C2H4): Both C atoms have three bonding pairs and no lone pairs, meaning they are both sp2 hybridized.
Methylamine (CH3NH2): Both the carbon and the nitrogen atom are sp3-hybridized. The C-N sigma bond is an overlap between two sp3 orbitals. Hybridization . The concept of hybridization is defined as the process of combining two atomic orbitals to create a new type of hybridized orbitals. This intermixing typically results in the formation of hybrid orbitals with completely different energies, shapes, and so on. Hybridization is primarily carried out by atomic orbitals of the same energy level. However, both fully filled and half-filled orbitals can participate in this process if their energies are equal. The concept of hybridization is an extension of valence bond theory that helps us understand bond formation, bond energies, and bond lengths.

What is Hybridization?

When two atomic orbitals combine to form a hybrid orbital in a molecule, the energy of the orbitals of individual atoms is redistributed to give orbitals of equivalent energy. This is known as hybridization. 
Steps to determine the type of Hybridisation
To understand the type of hybridization in an atom or an ion, the following rules must be followed.

First, determine the total number of valence electrons contained in an atom or ion.
Then, count the number of lone pairs attached to that atom or ion.
Now, the number of orbitals required can be calculated by adding the number of duplex or octet and the number of lone pairs of electrons.
It should be noted that the geometry of orbitals in atoms or ions is different when there is no lone pair of electrons.Features of Hybridization
Hybridization occurs between atomic orbitals with equal energies.
The number of hybrid orbitals formed equals the number of atomic orbitals that mix.
It is not required for all half-filled orbitals to participate in hybridization. Even orbitals that are completely filled but have slightly varying energy can participate.
Hybridization occurs only during bond formation, not in a single gaseous atom.
If the hybridization of the molecule is known, the molecule’s shape can be predicted.
The larger lobe of the hybrid orbital is always positive, while the smaller lobe on the opposite side is always negative.Types of Hybridization
Hybridization can be classified as sp3, sp2, sp, sp3d, sp3d2, or sp3d3 based on the types of orbitals involved in mixing.

sp Hybridization
It occurs when one s and one p orbital in an atom’s main shell combine to form two new equivalent orbitals. The newly formed orbitals are known as sp hybridized orbitals. It produces linear molecules at a 180° angle. It entails combining one’s orbital and one ‘p’ orbital of equal energy to produce a new hybrid orbital known as an sp hybridized orbital. 

It’s also known as diagonal hybridization. 
Each sp hybridized orbital contains the same amount of s and p characters. 
All beryllium compounds, such as BeF2, BeH2, and BeCl2, are examples.sp2 Hybridization
It occurs when one s and two p orbitals of the same atom’s shell combine to form three equivalent orbitals. The newly formed orbitals are known as sp2 hybrid orbitals. It’s also known as trigonal hybridization. It entails combining one’s orbital with two ‘p’ orbitals of equal energy to create a new hybrid orbital known as sp2. A trigonal symmetry mixture of s and p orbitals is kept at 120 degrees. All three hybrid orbitals remain in the same plane and form a 120° angle with one another. 

Each hybrid orbital formed has a 33.33 % and a 66.66 % ‘p’ character. 
The molecules with a triangular planar shape have a central atom that is linked to three other atoms and is sp2 hybridized.  sp3 Hybridization
When one ‘s’ orbital and three ‘p’ orbitals from the same shell of an atom combine to form four new equivalent orbitals, the hybridization is known as tetrahedral hybridization or sp3. The newly formed orbitals are known as sp3 hybrid orbitals. These are pointed at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron and form a 109°28? angle with one another. ",0,1,0,0,0
39,Thermodynamics,"Thermodynamics is concerned with the ideas of heat and temperature, as well as the exchange of heat and other forms of energy. The branch of science that is known as thermodynamics is related to the study of various kinds of energy and its interconversion. The behaviour of these quantities is governed by three main laws of thermodynamics, which provide a quantitative description. The word thermodynamics was coined by William Thomson in 1749. The following section dives into some of the most commonly used thermodynamic terminologies.What is Thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics is a field of science that investigates the links between heat, work, and temperature, as well as their interactions with energy, radiation, and the physical properties of matter. Thermodynamics, in its broadest sense, is associated with the transfer of energy from one location to another and from one form to another. 
Heat is a type of energy that corresponds to a specific quantity of mechanical work, which is the key concept. It discusses how thermal energy is transformed to or from other forms of energy, as well as how this process affects matter. The energy derived from heat is known as thermal energy. The movement of microscopic particles within an object generates heat, and the faster these particles move, the more heat is produced. Thermodynamics is unconcerned about the rate at which these energy transformations occur. It is based on the change occurring in the initial and final states. It’s also worth noting that thermodynamics is a macroscopic field of study. This means it is concerned with the bulk system rather than the molecular structure of matter.

Basic Concepts of Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics has its own set of terms related to it. A thorough comprehension of the fundamental ideas ensures a deep understanding of the numerous topics covered in thermodynamics, avoiding any misunderstandings. Thermodynamic concepts are covered below.

System. The system refers to a specific part of the universe that is being observed. A thermodynamic system is a part of matter with a defined boundary on which we concentrate our attention. The system boundary can be real or imaginary, and it can be fixed or movable. There are three different types of systems.

Open System – An open system is one that can exchange matter as well as energy with its surroundings. As a result, mass and energy can be transmitted between the system and its surroundings in an open system. Since it gains and loses matter as well as energy, hot coffee in an open flask is an example of an open system. An open system is a steam turbine, for example.
Closed System – A closed system exchanges energy but does not exchange matter with its surroundings. The transmission of energy takes place across the closed system’s boundary, but the transfer of mass does not. Closed systems include refrigerators and gas compression in piston-cylinder assemblies. Coffee in a stainless flask is also an example of a closed system because energy, but not matter, can flow through the steel walls.
Isolated System – An isolated system is one that is unable to exchange matter or energy with its surroundings. There is no such thing as a system that is completely isolated. An isolated system, on the other hand, is one that is entirely sealed to prevent matter intake or outflow and is thermally insulated to prevent heat flow. The universe is believed to be self-contained. Since it cannot gain or lose energy or matter, hot coffee in a corked thermos flask is an example of an isolated system.Applications of First Law of Thermodynamics.Energy, like matter, is always conserved, which means that it cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another. Internal energy is a thermodynamic attribute of a system that refers to the energy associated with the system’s molecules and comprises both kinetic and potential energy. Whenever a system undergoes a change as a result of the interaction of heat, work, and internal energy, it is followed by a series of energy transfers and conversions. However, there is no net change in total energy throughout these exchanges. Similarly, the fundamental law of thermodynamics confirms that heat is a type of energy. This means that thermodynamic processes are guided by the concept of energy conservation. The first law of thermodynamics is often known as the Law of Energy Conservation.First Law of Thermodynamics
A thermodynamic system in equilibrium has a state variable known as internal energy (E). The difference in internal energy between two systems is equal to the difference between heat transfer into the system and work done by the system. The energy of the universe remains constant, according to the first law of thermodynamics. It can be exchanged between the system and the environment, but it cannot be generated or destroyed. The law is primarily concerned with changes in energy states caused by work and heat transmission. It reimagines the concept of energy conservation.The equation for the first law of thermodynamics is given as;

?U = q + W

where: ?U is the change in the internal energy of the system, q is the algebraic sum of heat transfer between system and surroundings, W is the work interaction of the system with its surroundings.

Energy (E) is always constant in an isolated system.
Internal Energy is a system property and a point function. Internal energy is a broad (mass-dependent) characteristic, whereas specific energy is a narrow (mass-independent) attribute (independent of mass).
The internal energy of an ideal gas is just a function of temperature.Limitations of First Law of Thermodynamics 

When a system goes through a thermodynamic process, it must always maintain a precise energy balance, according to the law. The first law, on the other hand, fails to provide the feasibility of the process or change of state that the system goes through. 
The first law, for example, does not explain why heat transfers from the hot end to the cold end when a metallic rod is heated at one end but not the other, and vice versa. 
The first law only quantifies the amount of energy transferred during this process. The second law of thermodynamics serves as a benchmark for the feasibility of various processes.Internal Energy as a State of System.The various forms of energy are interconnected, and they can be converted from one form to another under certain conditions. The field of science known as thermodynamics is related to the study of various kinds of energy and its conversion. In thermodynamics, the system refers to the part of the universe that is being observed, whereas the surrounding refers to the rest of the universe that isn’t part of the system. Every substance has a specific amount of energy that is determined by the substance’s type, such as, temperature, and pressure. Internal energy is the terminology for this. The internal energy change as a state function or as a state of the system is described further down.

What is the State of a System?
A system’s state is defined as its state of existence when its macroscopic characteristics have definite values. The state of the system is said to change if any of the system’s macroscopic characteristics change. State variables are the measurable properties needed to describe a system’s state. The state variables are temperature, pressure, volume, composition, and so on. Consider the case of a system formed of an ideal gas. Only three variables, such as temperature, pressure, and volume, may define the state of this system.Internal Energy
Every substance has a specific amount of energy that is determined by factors like the chemical nature of the substance, temperature, and pressure. The term “intrinsic energy” or “internal energy” refers to this type of energy. The letter U is used to signify it (earlier it was represented by the symbol E). It is made up of the individual particles’ kinetic energy and potential energy. 

Translational energy, rational energy, vibrational energy, and other forms of kinetic energy emerge from the motion of its particles. Electronic energy, energy due to molecular interactions, nuclear energy, and other types of interactions between particles all contribute to potential energy. Chemical energy is also stored in the bonds that hold molecules together, and weaker long-range interactions between molecules require even more energy. The total internal energy of a substance in a particular thermodynamic state is the sum of all these kinds of energy. A system’s total energy contains its internal energy as well as any external sources of energy, such as kinetic energy from the system’s overall motion, and gravitational potential energy from its elevation.
Internal Energy as the State of System
A variety of thermodynamic characteristics, such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and enthalpy, can be used to define a thermodynamic system. These are grouped into two categories: state functions and path functions. A state function is a property of a system whose value is determined by the system’s initial and final states.  These types of functions explain a function’s equilibrium state and are unaffected by how the system got there. Internal energy, for example, is a state function that is independent of the path taken to change the system’s state. ?U=UB – UA.The internal energy difference (?U) has a set value and is unaffected by the path followed between two states A and B. The difference between the products’ and reactants’ internal energies, i.e. the change in internal energy, can be considered for chemical reactions.


?U=Uproducts – Ureactants


?U =Up – Ur


where Up denotes the internal energy of the products, Ur denotes the internal energy of the reactants, and ?U denotes the internal energy change.What is Enthalpy?

Heat absorbed or evolved at constant pressure is called heat of the reaction or enthalpy of the reaction. The change in enthalpy accompanying a reaction is called the reaction enthalpy,


Product ? Reactant
Enthalpy can also be defined as the total heat content of the system. It’s equal to the sum of internal energy and pressure-volume work. The internal energy change follows the first law of thermodynamics, according to which:
q = ?U + P?V
where, 
U is internal energy and
H is a static function.Enthalpies for Different Types of Reactions. Thermodynamics is a field of physics that studies the relationship between heat, work, and temperature, as well as their relationships with energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation. The four principles of thermodynamics regulate the behaviour of these quantities, which provide a quantitative description using quantifiable macroscopic physical quantities but may be described in terms of microscopic elements using statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics is a branch of science and engineering that covers a vast range of topics, including physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering, as well as other complex fields like meteorology.Enthalpies of Different Types of Reactions
The enthalpy of a system is the product of its internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It’s also referred to as heat content. That is to say,


H = E + PV


Where,
E = Internal energy of the system
P = Pressure of the system
V = Volume of the system
The absolute value of enthalpy cannot be calculated because it is a state function. On the other hand, a change in enthalpy (?H) associated with a process may be measured precisely and is supplied by the formula.

?H = Hproducts – Hreactants= Hp – Hr",0,1,0,0,0
40,sets,"Representation of a Set.Imagine a very haphazard world where no categories are divided to memorize and classify things separately, a world like this will be full of chaos and mess, this is why humans prefer to categorize things and classify them to neatly understand and remember them. The same case happens in mathematics, studying math involves dealing with a lot of data, and when the data can be grouped, it is preferred to group them and categorize them, hence, Sets come into play.What are the Sets in Mathematics?
Sets are defined as the collection of well-defined data. In Math, a Set is a tool that helps to classify and collect data belonging to the same category, even though the elements used in sets are all different from each other, they all are similar as they belong to one group. For instance, a set of different outdoor games, say set A= {Football, basketball, volleyball, cricket, badminton} all the games mentioned are different, but they all are similar in one way as they belong to the same group (outdoor games).

The set is denoted as a capital letter, for example, set A, set B, etc., and the elements belonging to the set are denoted as a small letter, and they are kept in curly brackets {}, for example, set A= {a, b, c, d}, as it is clear that a, b, c, d belong to set A, it can be written a ? A, do p belong to set A? No. Therefore, it will be written as, p? A.Representation of Sets
Sets can be represented in two ways, one is known as the Roster form and the other is famous as the Set-Builder form, these two forms can be used to represent the same data, but the style varies in both cases.Roster Form
In Roster Form, the elements are inside {}? Curly brackets. All the elements are mentioned inside and are separated by commas. Roster form is the easiest way to represent the data in groups. For example, the set for the table of 5 will be, A= {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35…..}.Properties of Roster Formrelations of Sets:

The arrangement in the Roster form does not necessarily to be in the same order every time. For example, A= {a, b, c, d, e} is equal to A= {e, d, a, c, b}.
The elements are not repeated in the set in Roster form, for example, the word “apple” will be written as, A= {a, p, l, e}
The Finite sets are represented either with all the elements or if the elements are too much, they are represented as dots in the middle. The infinite sets are represented with dots in the end.Set-Builder Form
In Set-builder form, elements are shown or represented in statements expressing relations among elements. The standard form for Set-builder, A= {a: statement}. For example, A = {x: x = a3, a ? N, a < 9}

Properties of Set-builder form:

In order to write the set in Set- builder form, the data should follow a certain pattern.
Colons (:) are necessary in Set-builder form.
After colon, the statement is to be written.Order of the Set
The order of the Set is determined by the number of elements present in the Set. For example, if there are 10 elements in the set, the order of the set becomes 10. For finite sets, the order of the set is finite, and for infinite sets, the order of the set is infinite.Types Of Sets.Sets are a well-defined collection of objects. Objects that a set contains are called the elements of the set. We can also consider sets as collections of elements that have a common feature. For example, the collection of even numbers is called the set of even numbers.What is Set?
A well-defined collection of Objects or items or data is known as a set. The objects or data are known as the element. For Example, the boys in a classroom can be put in one set, all integers from 1 to 100 can become one set, and all prime numbers can be called an Infinite set. The symbol used for sets is {…..}. Only the collection of data with specific characteristics is called a set.Types of Sets in Mathematics
Sets are the collection of different elements belonging to the same category and there can be different types of sets seen. A set may have an infinite number of elements, may have no elements at all, may have some elements, may have just one element, and so on. Based on all these different ways, sets are classified into different types.Singleton Set
Singleton Sets are those sets that have only 1 element present in them.
Example: 
Set A= {1} is a singleton set as it has only one element, that is, 1.
Set P = {a : a is an even prime number} is a singleton set as it has only one element 2.Empty Set
Empty sets are also known as Null sets or Void sets. They are the sets with no element/elements in them. They are denoted as ?.
Example:
Set A= {a: a is a number greater than 5 and less than 3}
Set B= {p: p are the students studying in class 7 and class 8}.Finite Set
Finite Sets are those which have a finite number of elements present, no matter how much they’re increasing number, as long as they are finite in nature, They will be called a Finite set.
Example: 
Set A= {a: a is the whole number less than 20}
Set B = {a, b, c, d, e}.Infinite Set
Infinite Sets are those that have an infinite number of elements present, cases in which the number of elements is hard to determine are known as infinite sets. 
Example: 
Set A= {a: a is an odd number}
Set B = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,…..}.Equal Set
Two sets having the same elements and an equal number of elements are called equal sets. The elements in the set may be rearranged, or they may be repeated, but they will still be equal sets.
Example:
Set A = {1, 2, 6, 5}
Set B = {2, 1, 5, 6}
In the above example, the elements are 1, 2, 5, 6. Therefore, A= B.Equivalent Set
Equivalent Sets are those which have the same number of elements present in them. It is important to note that the elements may be different in both sets but the number of elements present is equal. For Instance, if a set has 6 elements in it, and the other set also has 6 elements present, they are equivalent sets.Example:
Set A= {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
Set B = {p, q, r, s, t}
Set A and Set B both have 5 elements hence, both are equivalent sets.Subset
Set A will be called the Subset of Set B if all the elements present in Set A already belong to Set B. The symbol used for the subset is ?

If A is a Subset of B, It will be written as A ? B
Example:
Set A= {33, 66, 99}
Set B = {22, 11, 33, 99, 66}
Then, Set A ? Set B .Power Set
Power set of any set A is defined as the set containing all the subsets of set A. It is denoted by the symbol P(A) and read as Power set of A.

For any set A containing n elements, the total number of subsets formed is 2n. Thus, the power set of A, P(A) has 2n elements.
Example: For any set A = {a,b,c}, the power set of A is?
Solution:Power Set P(A) is,P(A) = {?, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}, {c, a}, {a, b, c}}
Universal Set 
A universal set is a set that contains all the elements of the rest of the sets. It can be said that all the sets are the subsets of Universal sets. The universal set is denoted as U.
Example: For Set A = {a, b, c, d} and Set B = {1,2} find the universal set containing both sets.Solution:
Universal Set U is,
U = {a, b, c, d, e, 1, 2}.Disjoint Sets
For any two sets A and B which do have no common elements are called Disjoint Sets. The intersection of the Disjoint set is ?, now for set A and set B A?B =  ?. 
Example: Check whether Set A ={a, b, c, d} and Set B= {1,2} are disjoint or not.
Solution:Set A ={a, b, c, d}
Set B= {1,2}
Here, A?B =  ?
Thus, Set A and Set B are disjoint sets.Universal Set.Universal Set is a set that has all the elements associated with a given set, without any repetition. Suppose we have two sets P = {1, 3, 5} and Q = {2, 4, 6} then the universal set of P and Q is U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We generally use U to denote universal sets.

Universal Set is a type of set that is used to represent all the possible elements associated with a set. It is widely used in probability to represent all possible sample space of an event. In this article, we will learn about, Universal sets, Examples of Universal Sets, Complements of Universal Sets, Venn Diagram of Universal Sets, and others in detail.Universal Sets Symbol
We use English Letter ‘U‘ for representing Universal Set. It contain all the elements associate with the concerning sets.Universal Sets Examples
Examples of universal set are,

Set of Complex Number is the universal set of all the numbers as it contains all the numbers.
Suppose we have three sets,
Set A = (Alphabets in Government)
Set B = {a, e, i, o, u}
Set C = (Alphabets in Country)
Then the universal set of set A, set B, and set C is,
U = (All alphabets in English Language).Complements of Universal Sets
We know that universal set U is a set that contains all the elements of subsets, so compelement of the universal set is a set that contain no elements of the subsets. Thus, we can say that, the complement of the universal set is an Empty Set Or Null Set. A null set is denoted by ‘{}’ or ‘?’ symbol.

Venn Diagram of Universal Set
Venn Diagrams are used to represent relation between sets using pictorials methods. We use circles to represent various sets. A universal set is a set that contains all the elements associated with all the sets in considerations. We use rectangles to represents Universal Sets.What is a Venn Diagram?
Venn Diagrams are used to represent the groups of data in circles, if the circles are overlapping, some elements in the groups are common, if they are not overlapping, there is nothing common between the groups or sets of data.
A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of mathematical or logical relationships between different sets. It consists of overlapping circles, each representing a set, with the overlapping areas illustrating the common elements shared by the sets. Venn Diagrams are used for Visual Representation of Relationships as they provide a clear, visual method for showing how different sets intersect, overlap, or remain distinct. This helps in understanding complex relationships between sets in mathematics.Venn Diagram of Union of Sets
The Union of two or more two sets represents the data of the sets without repeating the same data more than once, it is shown with the symbol ??.
n(A? B) = {a: a? A OR a? B}.Venn Diagram of Intersection of Sets
The intersection of two or more two sets means extracting only the amount of data that is common between/among the sets. The symbol used for the intersection? ?.

n(A? B)= {a: a? A and a? B}.Operations on Sets.Sets are fundamental in mathematics and are collections of distinct objects, considered as a whole. In this article, we will explore the basic operations you can perform on sets, such as union, intersection, difference, and complement. These operations help us understand how sets interact with each other and allow us to solve various problems in mathematics and beyond.Operations on Sets
Union of Sets
Intersection of Sets  
Difference of Sets
Complement of Sets.Intersection of Sets  
The intersection of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are common to both A and B. Formally it is written as 

A ? B = \{ x: x \in A \ and \ x \in B \}.Union of Sets
Union of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A or in B or in both A and B. Formally it is written as

A ? B = {x: x ? A or x ? B}.Complement or Difference Between Sets
The relative complement or set difference of two sets A and B is the set containing all the elements that are in A but not in B. Formally this is written as 

A - B = \{ x: x \in A \  and \  x \notin B \}  .Universal Set and Absolute Complement
Universal set
A universal set is the set of all objects currently under consideration. It is usually denoted by the upper-case letter U. For example for a set of vowels, the universal set may be the set of alphabets.

Note: A set is always a subset of the universal set.

41,Relations & Functions,"Cartesian Product of Sets.‘Product‘ mathematically signifies the result obtained when two or more values are multiplied together. For example, 45 is the product of 9 and 5. One must be familiar with the basic operations on sets like Union and Intersection, which are performed on 2 or more sets.
Cartesian Product is also one such operation that is performed on two sets, which returns a set of ordered pairs.What is an Ordered Pair?
An ordere­d pair has two parts. The first part is called the first compone­nt. The second part is called the­ second component. We write­ an ordered pair like this: (a, b). The­ letter ‘a’ is the first compone­nt. The letter ‘b’ is the­ second component. An ordere­d pair has two things. One thing comes first. The othe­r thing comes second.Example:
(5, 7) is an ordered pair of integers.Cartesian Product of Sets
When two se­ts have items in them, A and B, the­ir Cartesian product is all the pairs you can make. One­ part of the pair comes from set A. The­ other part comes from set B. We­ make every possible­ pair this way. The result is a new se­t of all these pairs. We write­ this new set as A×B.
A × B = {(a, b) : a ? A and b ? B}
Example: 
Let A = {1, 2} and B = {4, 5, 6}
A × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}.Properties of Cartesian Product
Various properties of cartesian product includes,

1. Cartesian Product is non-commutative: A × B ? B × A.2. A × B = B × A, only if A = B.3. Cardinality of Cartesian Product is defined as number of elements in A × B and is equal to the product of cardinality of both sets i.e.,
|A × B| = |A| × |B|.4. A × B = ?, if either A = ? or B = ?.Relation and Function.Relation and Function are two ways of establishing links between two sets in mathematics. Relation and Function in maths are analogous to the relation that we see in our daily lives i.e., two persons are related by the relation of father-son, mother-daughter, brother-sister, and many more. On a similar pattern, two numbers can be related to each other as one number is the square of another number and many more. A function is a special kind of relation that is defined as a unique relation between two mathematical entities.

Relation and Functions are introduced in Class 11, and in Class 12 more advanced subtopics are taught in CBSE Syllabus. In this article, we will learn about relation and function, their definitions, relation and function examples, their representation, terms related to them, and the difference between relation and function in detail.What is Relation and Function?
Relation and Functions are the ways of mapping the establishing link between two entities in mathematics. They are used to establish mathematical relations between two terms. Relation and Function are studied under algebra and also used in calculus to find integration and differentiation.Relation Definition
Relation is defined as a relationship between a non-empty set A to no-empty set B such that Relation from A to B is a subset of Cartesian Product of A and B i.e. R ? A × B.
Function Definition
Function is a special type of relation in which the two entities are exclusively related to each other only. A relation from set A to set B is defined as function if all the elements of set A are related to at least one element of B and no two elements of B are related to a single element of A.A function is represented as
f:A?Bindicates that f is a function from set A (domain) to set B (codomain).Representation of Relation and Function
Relation and Function are in general the same with some basic difference. They both take input, process it and relates to output. They can be represented in the following forms:Roster Form
In roster form the elements of two sets among which relation is defined are written in the form of ordered pair.Set Builder Form
In set builder form the relation is not written in expanded pair form rather it is written in compressed form using an algebraic expression to define the relation between two sets.Arrow Diagram
In arrow diagram the relation is shown using connecting the elements of the sets which are contained in the box using arrows.Lattice Diagram
In lattice diagrams the elements which are linked to each other by a relation are plotted on cartesian plane.Terms Related to Relation and Function
Some of the commonly used terms associated with Relation and Function are discussed below:

Domain
Domain of Relation or a function is the set of inputs for which the outputs are obtained. For Example, in A = {-1, 0, 1, 2} and B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and set A is related to set B as a2 = b, the set A is the domain of the relation.

Codomain
Codomain is the set of outputs or the image of the relation and function. Codomain may contain exact or more number of elements than the output. For Example, in A = {-1, 0, 1, 2} and B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and set A is related to set B as a2 = b, set B is the codomain. In set B there is element 3 which is not a perfect square hence it will not have a pre-image.

Range
Range is the set of all outputs which has a pre image. In range all elements are related. Hence, it has has exact number of elements for which relation is defined. Thus, Range is subset of codomain. For Example, in A = {-1, 0, 1, 2} and B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and set A is related to set B as a2 = b, Range is {0, 1, 2, 4}.Cartesian Product
Let’s assume A and B to be two non-empty sets, the sets of all ordered pairs (x, y) where x ? A and y ? B is called a Cartesian product of the sets. A × B = {(x, y) | x ? A and y ? B}.Types of Relation and Function
Relation and Function are classified on the basis of the input it take and output it gives for a given relation. The different types of Relation and Function are discussed separately below:

Types of Relation.There are eight different types of relations which are listed below:

Empty Relation- There is no relation between any elements of a set.
Universal Relation- Every element of the set is related to each other.
Identity Relation- In an identity relation, every element of a set is related to itself only.
Inverse Relation- Inverse relation is seen when a set has elements that are inverse pairs of another set.
Reflexive Relation- In a reflexive relation, every element maps to itself.
Symmetric Relation- In asymmetric relation, if a=b is true then b=a is also true.
Transitive Relation- For transitive relation, if (x, y) ? R, (y, z) ? R, then (x, z) ? R.
Equivalence Relation- A relation that is symmetric, transitive, and reflexive at the same time.Types of Function
We know that in a function no two images can have one common pre-image and all the pre-images must have an image. A function ‘f’ defined from A × B is classified as follows

One-One Function(Injection): A function ‘f’ from A to B is said to be One-One or Injection if each element of A is mapped with a different element in B. One-One Function is also called an Injective Function.
Many-One Function: A function ‘f’ from A to B is said to be Many-One or Injection if two or more elements of A is mapped with a common element in B. It means two elemts in A can have common image in B.
Onto Function(Surjection): A function ‘f’ from A to B is said to be Onto Function if all the elements of set B has a pre-image in set A i.e. no element in set B remains unmapped.
Into Function: A function ‘f’ from A to B is said to be Into Function if at least one image in set B does not have a pre-image in set A i.e. one element of set B remains unmapped.
One-One Onto Function: A function ‘f’ from A to B is said to be One-One Onto function if all the elements of set A has a unique image in set B and all the elements of set B has a pre-image in set A. This type of function exhibits characteristics of One One Function and Onto Function. One-One Onto Function is also called Bijection Function.Introduction to Domain and Range.To understand the concept of Domain and range of a Relation first, we have to learn about Relation. A relation is a set of rules which relates the value of one set to the value of other sets. 

The domain of a relation is the set of values that we take as input and the range is the set of the values which are obtained in the form of the answers to the relation.

In this article, we will learn about the Domain and Range of Relations, its examples, and others.

What is a Relation?
For any two non-empty sets A and B, we define the relation R as the subset of the  Cartesian product of A × B where each member of set A is related to the member of set B through some unique rule.

We defined relation as,

R = {(x,y): x ? A and y ? B}.Types of Relations
There are the following types of relations between two sets:

Universal relation
Empty relation
Identity relation
Symmetric relation
Inverse relation
Reflexive relation
Transitive relation.Universal Relations
A relation is called a universal connection if each element of set A is related to another element of set A i.e. R =  A × A.

Empty Relations
The relation wherein there is no connection between any components of a set is called an empty relation. An empty relation is also called void relation.

Consider if set A = {2, 3} then, empty relation is R = {m,n} where, |m-n| = 8.

Identity Relations
The relation where each component of a set is identified with itself is called Identity Relations.

Consider a set A = {1,2,3}, the identity relation will be I = {1,1}, {2,2}, {3,3}. 

I = {(m,m), m ? A}.Symmetric Relations
A relation is symmetric if a = b holds true then b = a also holds true. A connection R is symmetric just if (b, a) ? R is then (a,b) ? R.

R = {(1, 2), (2, 1)} is symmetric relation set for a set A = {1, 2}. 

Inverse Relations
Inverse relation occurs when a set has inverse pairs of another set. i.e. if R ? A × B then the inverse relation is R-1 = {(b,a) such that (a,b) ? R}

Consider if set A = {(1,2),(3,4)}, then inverse relation will be R-1 = {(2,1), (4,3)}.

Reflexive Relations
A relation where each component of a set A is mapped to itself is called reflexive relation, i.e. for every x ? A, (a, a) ? R.Transitive Relations
If for any relation (m,n) ? R  and (n,p) ? R, then if (m,p) ? R is 

Consider aRb and bRc ? aRc ? a, b, c ? A

Domain and Range of a Relation
As we know any set of ordered pairs that are related to a unique relation we have domain and range i.e. for R such that R(A×B) such that {(a, b) where a ? A and b ? B} we have domain and range of R. 

Here the set of values of A is called the domain and the set of values of b is called the range.

Domain of a Relation
Domain of any Relation is the set of input values of the relation. For example, if we take two sets A and B, and define a relation R: {(a,b): a ? A, b ? B} then the set of values of A is called the domain of the function.Range of a Relation
Range of any Relation is the set of output values of the relation. For example, if we take two sets A and B, and define a relation R: {(a,b): a ? A, b ? B} then the set of values of B is called the domain of the function.Codomain of Relation
We define the codomain of the relation R as the set B of the cartesian product A×B on which the relation is defined. Now it is clear that the range of the function is the proper subset of Codomain.

Range ? Codomain.Piecewise Function.Piecewise Function is a function that behaves differently for two types of input. As we know a function is a mathematical object which associates each input with exactly one output. For example: If a function takes on any input and gives the output as 3. It can be represented mathematically as f(x) = 3. But in the case of the Piecewise function, it is defined by individual expressions for each interval.

A piecewise function is defined across different intervals, each with its own specific function rule. A well-known example of such a function is the absolute value. Other examples of piecewise functions include the Heaviside step function, the rectangle function, and the triangle function, each characterized by distinct behaviors over their respective intervals.What is Piecewise Function?
Piecewise Function is a function that is defined differently on a sequence of intervals. In other words, a piecewise function is a mathematical function that is defined by multiple sub-functions, with each sub-function being valid only in a certain interval or region of the domain. In other words, a piecewise function is a function that is defined differently on different parts of its domain.Piecewise Function Definition
A piecewise function, also known as a piecewise-defined function, is a function that is defined by different expressions or formulas on different intervals of its domain. This enables us to accurately describe functions that exhibit varying behaviors or properties within different ranges of input values.
Domain and Range of Piecewise Function
Domain and Range of a piecewise function can be calculated using the domain and range of the individual pieces and taking the union of that range and domains. Piecewise Function Graph
To graph the Piecewise Function, we just need to graph the function individually for all the different intervals it is defined.Piecewise Function Examples
There are many famous examples of piecewise functions, some of which are as follows:

Modulus Function
Floor Function
Ceiling Function
Unit Step Function
Signum Function.Modulus Function
It is also called the absolute value function, and it is defined in two pieces as follows:

 \bold{f(x)= \begin{cases}x,& \text{if } x\geq 0\\-x,& \text{if } x<0 \end{cases}}  .Greatest Integer Function or Floor Function
The floor function also called the greatest integer function or integer value, gives the largest integer less than or equal to x. The domain for this function is all the real numbers R while the range of this function is all the integers Z. ",0,0,1,0,0
42,Trigonometric Functions,"Measuring Angles.Measurement of angles is very important in geometry for solving various geometrical problems and comparing angles in various geometrical figures. We use various geometric tools such as a protractor, and a compass for measuring angles. There are various types of angles measured by us and before learning more about measuring angles we should first learn more about what is an angle.What is an Angle?
When two rays are extended together to meet at a point they are formed an angle. Thus, we define the angle as the shape in geometry formed by joining the two rays together. The meeting point of the two rays is called the vertex of the angel and the two rays are called the arm of the angle.Types of Angles
On the basis of the measure of the angles, we divide the angles into seven different categories, that are,

Acute Angle: The angles formed between 0° to 90 is called the acute angles.
Right Angle: If the measure of the angle is exactly equal to 90° it is called the right angle.
Obtuse Angle: The angles formed between 90° to 180 is called the acute angles.
Straight Angle: If the measure of the angle is exactly equal to 180° it is called the straight angle.
Reflex Angle: The angles formed between 180° to 360 are called reflex angles.
Full Rotation: If the measure of the angle is exactly equal to 360° it is called the full rotation.What is Measuring Angles?
We can measure the angle using various geometrical tools such as a protractor and a compass. Using these tools we can easily find the exact measure of the angles. The protractor is best suited for measuring the various angles exactly as a compass can measure very few angles exactly with lots of difficulties. We can measure the angle in three categories, i.e. in,

Degrees
Radians
Revolution.Degrees
We define degree as the unit of measuring the angles. A protractor measured the angle in degrees. It is denoted by the ‘°’ symbol. We divide a circle into 360° and thus a semi-circle has 180°. One complete rotation is also called 360°.

Radians
We also measure the angles in radians. It is the SI unit for measuring the angles. It is defined as the ratio of the length of the arc to the radius of the circle at a particular angle. We denote the angle using rad or c and is written as 2 radians or 2 rad or 2c. One complete rotation or 360° equals 2? rad. Thus, we can say that,


? rad = 180°
We can easily convert Degree to Radian or vice versa using the above formula.

Degrees and Radians Formula
As we know that a circle subtends 2? rad or 360° at its centre.

So, 

2? radian = 360°.Revolution
The revolution is the simplest method of measuring the angle. We define one revolution as the complete rotation of the circle. We define revolution such that,

One Revolution = 2? Rad = 360°.How to Measure Angles Using a Protractor?
We can easily measure the angle using the protractor. A protractor is a geometrical tool made in the shape of a semi-circle and contains marking from 0° to 180°. It contains the same marking from left to right and right to left. We can use a protractor to measure any angle between 0° to 360°.Measuring Angle Greater than 180 Degrees
Any angle greater than 180 degrees can be easily measured using the protractor by just placing the protractor upside down and then measuring the angle normally as we measure the normal angles. Suppose we have to measure an angle whose value is 275 degrees, we put the protractor upside down such that the vertex of the angle coincides with the midpoint of the protractor and the edge of the protractor is parallel to the arm of the angle. Now we measure the value of the angle normally by following the steps discussed above.Properties of Angles
Various properties which are highly used in measuring the angles are,

We can measure the angle in two units,
Degrees
Radians
¼ revolution is equal to a right angle and ½ revolution is equal to a straight angle. If the measure of two angles is a right angle, then each angle measures 45 degrees.
If the measure of two angles is a straight angle and if one of the angles is acute then the other angle should be an obtuse angle.Trigonometric Functions.Trigonometric Functions, often simply called trig functions, are mathematical functions that relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of the lengths of its sides. These Trigonometric functions are fundamental in mathematics for units like Calculus and Geometry and have wide-ranging applications in science, engineering, and various other fields.Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric functions are the basic functions used in trigonometry and they are used for solving various types of problems in physics, Astronomy, Probability, and other branches of science. There are six basic trigonometric functions used in Trigonometry which are:

Sine Function
Cosine Function
Secant Function
Cosecant Function
Tangent Function
Cotangent Function.These trigonometric functions are used to represent the relation between the angles and the sides of the triangle and plotting the graph of these functions result in some interesting curves that are used for scientific purposes and represent various real-life incidents.Sine Function
Sine function of an angle is the ratio of perpendicular and the hypotenuse in the right angle triangle. Form the image added above,

sin ? = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse = PQ/PR
Cosine Function
Cosine function also known as Cos function of an angle is the ratio of base and the hypotenuse in the right angle triangle. Form the image added above,

cos ? = Base/Hypotenuse = QR/PR
Tangent Function
Tangent function also known Tan function of an angle is the ratio of perpendicular and the base in the right angle triangle. Form the image added above,

tan ? = Perpendicular/Base = PQ/QR.Secant, Cosecant, and Cotangent Functions
Secant(sec), Cosecant(cosec), and Cotangent(cot) functions are the reciprocal function of cos, sine, and tan function and there values is calculated as, (from the right-angled triangle PQR added above)

sec ? = Hypotenuse/Base = PR/PQ
cosec ? = Hypotenuse/Perpendicular = PR/QR
cot ? = Base/Perpendicular = QR/PQ.Trigonometric Functions Formulas
Formula for various trigonometric functions is given with the help of a right angle triangle. Suppose we have a right angle triangle ABC right angled at B then the side opposite to the angle A is called the perpendicular and the side opposite to angle B is called the Base of the triangle and the side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse(which is also the largest side of the triangle).

Then the basic trigonometric functions formulas for this right angle triangle is,

sin ? = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse
cos ? = Base/Hypotenuse
tan ? = Perpendicular/Base
sec ? = Hypotenuse/Base
cosec ? = Hypotenuse/Perpendicular
cot ? = Base/Perpendicular
Observing the above formula it is evident that sec ?, cosec ?, and cot ? are simply the reciprocal values of sin ?, cos ?, and tan ? respectively.

Trigonometric Functions Values
Value of trigonometric functions can easily be given using the trigonometry table. These values of the trigonometric functions are very useful in solving the various trigonometric problems. Trigonometric Functions in Four(4) Quadrants
The trigonometric functions are the periodic functions and their value repeat after a certain interval. Also, not all the trigonometric functions are positive in all the quadrants.

We divide the cartesian space into four quadrants namely, I, II, III and IV quadrants, and the value of the trigonometric functions whether they are positive or negative in each quadrant is given as,

I Quadrant: All Positive
II Quadrant: sin ? and cosec ? Positive
III Quadrant: tan ? and cot ? Positive
IV Quadrant: cos ? and sec ? Positive.Graphs of Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric functions graphs plots the value of the trigonometric functions for different values of the angle(?). For some the trigonometric functions are bounded as,

Trigonometric functions sin ? and cos ? are bounded between – 1 and 1 and to their graphs oscillates between -1 and 1 on the y-axis.
Graph of the trigonometric function tan ?, and cot ? has a range from negative infinity to positive infinity.
Graph of the trigonometric function sec ?, and cosec ? has a range from negative infinity to positive infinity excluding (-1, 1).

csc(x+2n?) = csc x
sec(x+2n?) = sec x.Domain and Range of Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric functions are compared to normal functions so the domain and range of the trigonometric functions are comparable to normal function. Suppose we have a trigonometric function f(x) = sin x, then the domain of the function f(x) is all the values of x that the function f(x) can take, and the domain is all possible outcome of the f(x).Derivative of Trigonometric Functions
Differentiation of trigonometric function can be easily found and which the slope of that curve for that specific value of the trigonometric functions. The differentiation of all six trigonometric functions are added below:
d/dx (sin x) = cos x
d/dx (cos x) = -sin x
d/dx (tan x) = sec2x
d/dx (cot x) = -cosec2x
d/dx (sec x) = sec x tan x
d/dx (cosec x) = -cosec x cot x.Integration of Trigonometric Functions
As integration of any curve gives the area under the curve, the integration of trigonometric function also give the area under the trigonometric function. The integration of various trigonometric functions are added below.
? cos x dx = sin x + C
? sin x dx = -cos x + C
? tan x dx = log|sec x| + C
? cot x dx = log|sin x| + C

? sec2x dx = tan x + C
? cosec2x dx = -cot x + C
? sec x tan x dx = sec x + C
? cosec x cot x dx = -cosec x + C
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Inverse Trigonometric Functions are the inverse of the trigonometric function. Suppose we have a trigonometric function f(x) = sin x, such that sin x = a then f-1 (x) is the inverse of f(x) and is called the inverse trigonometric function and is defined as,
y = sin x
? x = sin-1(y).Inverse Trigonometric Reciprocal Functions

sin-1x + cos-1x = ?/2
tan-1x + cot-1x = ?/2
sec-1x + cosec-1x = ?/2.Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles.Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics, which deals with the angles, lengths, and heights of triangles and their relationships. It had played an important role in calculating complex functions or large distances which were not possible to calculate without trigonometry. While solving problems with trigonometry, we came across many situations where we had to calculate the trigonometric solutions for the sum of angles or differences of angles.Trigonometric identities
Now we are going to find the trigonometric identities. As we know that

sin(-x) = – sin x

cos(-x) = cos x",0,0,1,0,0
43,Principle of Mathematical Induction,"Principle of Mathematical Induction.Mathematical induction is a concept in mathematics that is used to prove various mathematical statements and theorems. The principle of mathematical induction is sometimes referred to as PMI. It is a technique that is used to prove the basic theorems in mathematics which involve the solution up to n finite natural terms. Principle of Mathematical Induction is widely used in proving various statements such as a sum of first n natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2. This can be easily proved using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.What is Mathematical Induction?
Mathematical Induction is one of the fundamental methods of writing proofs and it is used to prove a given statement about any well-organized set. Generally, it is used for proving results or establishing statements that are formulated in terms of n, where n is a natural number.

Suppose P(n) is a statement for n natural number then it can be proved using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, Firstly we will prove for P(1) then let P(k) be true then prove for P(k+1). If P(k+1) holds then we say that P(n) is true by the principle of mathematical induction.

We can compare mathematical induction to falling dominoes. When a domino falls, it knocks down the next domino in succession. The first domino knocks down the second one, the second one knocks down the third, and so on. In the end, all of the dominoes will be bowled over. But there are some conditions to be fulfilled:

Base step is that the starting domino must fall to set the knocking process in action.
The distance between dominoes must be equal for any two adjacent dominoes. Otherwise, a certain domino may fall down without bowling over the next. Then the sequence of reactions will stop. Maintaining the equal inter-domino distance ensures that P(k) ? P(k + 1) for each integer k ? a. This is the inductive step.Principle of Mathematical Induction Statement
Any statement P(n) which is for “n” natural number can be proved using the Principle of Mathematical Induction by following the below steps,

Step 1: Verify if the statement is true for trivial cases (n = 1) i.e. check if P(1) is true.


Step 2: Assume that the statement is true for n = k for some k ? 1 i.e. P(k) is true.


Step 3: If the truth of P(k) implies the truth of P(k + 1), then the statement P(n) is true for all n ? 1.Mathematical Induction Steps
Various steps used in Mathematical Induction are named accordingly. The names of the various steps used in the principle of mathematical induction are,

Base Step: Prove P(k) is true for k =1
Assumption Step: Let P(k) is true for all k in N and k > 1
Induction Step: Prove P(k+1) is true using basic mathematical properties.
If the above three steps are proved then we can say that “By the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n belonging to N”.Mathematical Induction Example
Mathematical induction is used to prove various statements we can learn this with the help of the following example.

For any positive integer number n, prove that n3 + 2n is always divisible by 3

Solution:

Let P(n): n3 + 2n is divisible by 3 be the given statement.


Step 1: Basic Step


Firstly we prove that P(1) is true. Let n = 1 in n3 + 2n
= 13 + 2(1) 
= 3


As 3 is divisible by 3. Hence, P(1) is true.


Step 2: Assumption Step


Let us assume that P(k) is true


Then, k3 + 2k is divisible by 3


Thus, we can write it as k3 + 2k = 3n,             (where n is any positive integer)….(i)


Step 3: Induction Steps


Now we have to prove that algebraic expression (k + 1)3 + 2(k + 1) is divisible by 3


= (k + 1)3 + 2(k + 1) 


= k3 + 3k2 + 5k + 3


= (k3 + 2 k) + (3k2 + 3k + 3)


from eq(i)


= 3n + 3(k2 + k + 1)


= 3(n + k2 + k + 1)


As it is a multiple of 3 we can say that it is divisible by 3.


Thus, P(k+1) is true i.e. (k + 1)3 + 2(k + 1) is be divisible by 3. Now by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we can say that, P(n): n3 + 2n is divisible by 3 is true.",0,0,1,0,0
44,Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations,"Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are an essential concept in mathematics, extending the idea of numbers to include solutions for equations that don’t have real solutions.
A complex number is expressed in the form a + bi, where a represents the real part, b represents the imaginary part, and i is the imaginary unit defined by i2 = -1.
For Example: 3 + 4i, 2i, 7-8i.
Complex numbers have applications in many scientific research, signal processing, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, and vibration analysis.
In this article, we will learn about complex numbers, and their types, properties, various operations, and their applications in real life.Complex Numbers Definition
Complex Numbers are the numbers of the form (a + i b) where a & b are the real numbers and i is an imaginary unit called iota that represents ?-1.
Complex numbers have two parts Real Part and Imaginary Part. For a complex number a+ib, a represents the real part and ib represents the imaginary part.
For example, 2 + 3i, is a complex number in which 2 is a real number and 3i is an imaginary number. They can be written as a + ib where a and b are rational numbers that can be represented on a number line extending to infinity.Power of iota 
(i)
The iota is referred by the alphabet ‘i’. iota is helpful to represent the imaginary part of the complex number. It is also very helpful to find the square root of negative numbers as the value of i2 = -1, which is used to find the value of square root of negative numbers.Modulus of Complex Number
Modulus of the Complex Number is the absolute value and represents the distance between the origin and the given point. It is also known as the magnitude of the complex number. Let’s consider z = a + ib then the modulus of z is defined as:
|z| = ?(a2 + b2)
Where, 
a is the real part of the complex number z, and 
b is the imaginary part of the complex number z.
Argument of Complex Number
The angle between the radius vector of a complex number and the positive x-axis is called the argument of a complex number. For a complex number z = a + ib, it is mathematically given by:
? = tan-1(b/a)
Where, 
a is the real part of the z, and 
b is the imaginary part of the z.
Classification of Complex Numbers
As we know the standard form of a complex number is z = (a + i b) where a, b ? R, and i is iota (an imaginary unit). So depending on the values of a (called real part) and b (called imaginary part), they are classified into four types:

Zero Complex Number
Purely Real Numbers 
Purely Imaginary Numbers
Imaginary Numbers
Let’s learn about these types in detail.

Zero Complex Number
For any complex number z = a + ib if a = 0 & b = 0, then it is called zero complex number. For example, the only example of this is 0.
Purely Real Numbers 
For any complex number z = a + ib if a ? 0 & b = 0, then it is called a purely real number i.e., a number with no imaginary part. All the real numbers are examples of this such that 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.
Purely Imaginary Numbers
For any complex number z = a + ib if a = 0 & b ? 0, then it is called a purely imaginary number i.e., a number with no real part. All numbers with no real parts are examples of this type of number i.e.,  -7i, -5i, -i, i, 5i, 7i, etc.Imaginary Numbers
For any complex number z = a + ib if a ? 0 & b ? 0, then it is called an imaginary number. For example,  (-1 – i), (1 + i), (1 – i), (2 + 3i), etc.Different Forms of Complex Numbers
There are various forms of complex numbers that are,

Rectangular Form 
Polar Form
Exponential Form
Now let’s learn about them in detail.

Rectangular Form 
Rectangular Form is also called Standard Form and it is represented by (a + ib), where a and b are the real numbers.

For example: (5 + 5i), (-7i), (-3 – 4i), etc.

Polar Form
Polar Form is the representation of a complex number where  polar coordinates [where coordinates are represented as (r, ?), where r is the distance from the origin and ? is the angle between the line joining the point and origin and the positive x-axis) are used to represent a complex number. Any complex number is represented as r [cos ? + i sin ?].

For examples: [cos ?/2 + i sin ?/2], 5[cos ?/6 + i sin ?/6], etc.Exponential Form 
Exponential Forms is the representation of complex numbers using Euler’s Formula and in this form the complex number is represented by rei?, where r is the distance of a point from the origin and ? is the angle between the positive x-axis and radius vector.

For examples: ei(0), ei(?/2), 5.ei(?/6), etc.

Note: All three forms of the complex numbers discussed above are interconvertible i.e., these can be converted from one form to another very easily.
Operations on Complex Numbers
The following operations can be performed on Complex Numbers:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Conjugation
Addition
We can add two complex numbers, by simply adding their real and imaginary parts separately. 

For example, (3 + 2i) + (1 + 4i) = 4 + 6i.Subtraction
We can subtract two complex numbers, by simply subtracting their real and their imaginary parts separately. 

For example, (3 + 2i) – (1 + 4i) = 2 – 2i.


Multiplication
We can multiply two complex numbers using the distributive property and the fact that i2 = -1.

For example, (3 + 2i)(1 + 4i) = 3 + 12i + 2i + 8i2 = 3 + 14i – 8 = -5 + 14i.


Division
We can divide one complex number by another, by simply multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator and further simplifying the expression. 

For example, (3 + 2i)/(1 + 4i) = (3 + 2i)(1 – 4i)/(1 + 4i)(1 – 4i) = (11 – 10i)/17.Conjugation of Complex Numbers
We can easily find the conjugate of a complex number, by simply changing the sign of its imaginary part. Conjugate of a complex number is often denoted with a bar above the number, such as z?.

For example, the conjugate of 3 + 2i is 3 – 2i. Formulas Related to Complex Numbers
There are some formulas related to complex numbers, some of which are as follows:

Euler’s Formula
Euler’s Formula shows the relation between the imaginary power of exponent and trigonometric ratio sin and cos and is given by:

eix = cos x + i sin x
De Moivre’s Formula
De Moivre’s Formula expresses the nth power of a complex number in polar form and is given by:

(cos x + i sin x)n = cos (nx) + i sin (nx)
Complex Plane
The plane on which the complex numbers are uniquely represented is called the Complex plane or Argand plane or Gaussian plane.

The Complex plane has two axes:

X-axis or Real Axis
Y-axis or Imaginary Axis
X-axis or Real Axis
All the purely real complex numbers are uniquely represented by a point on it.
Real part Re(z) of all complex numbers are plotted with respect to it.
That’s why X-axis is also called Real axis.
Y-axis or Imaginary Axis
All the purely imaginary complex numbers are uniquely represented by a point on it.
Imaginary part Im(z) of all complex numbers are plotted with respect to it.
That’s why Y-axis is also called Imaginary axis.Properties of Complex Numbers
There are various properties of complex numbers, some of which are as follows:

For any complex number z = a + ib, if z = 0 then a = 0 as well as b = 0.
For 4 real numbers a, b, c, and d such that z1 = a + ib and  z2 = c + id. If z1 = z2 then a = c, and b=d.
Addition of a complex number with its conjugate results in a purely real number i.e., z + z? = Real Number.Algebra of Real Functions.The algebra of real functions refers to the study and application of algebraic operations on functions that map real numbers to real numbers.

A function can be thought of as a rule or set of rules which map an input to an output knows as its image. It is represented as x ? Function ? y. A real function refers to a function that maps real numbers to real numbers.

Algebra of real functions involves algebraic operations between two or more real functions. In this article we will learn in detail about algebra of real functions such addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between real function.

Algebra of Real Function
The algebra of real functions involves operations and properties that apply to functions map real numbers to real numbers. These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, composition, and inversion, among others.

Sometimes, while working on complex problems, combining two or more functions is required. In this case, one might need to combine a cube function with an absolute function.Operation on Real Functions
We have explained in detail about different algebraic operation below.

Addition of Functions
Let f:X ? R and g:X ? R be any two real functions, where X ? R. Then we define (f + g): X ? R by 

(f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x), for all x ? X.Let D(f) and D(g) be the domain of the functions “f” and “g,” respectively. The domain in the case of function addition is given as

D(f + g) = D(f) ? D(g)
Subtraction of Functions
Let f:X ? R and g:X ? R be any two real functions, where X ? R. Then we define (f – g):X ? R by

(f – g) (x) = f (x) – g (x), for all x ? X



Let D(f) and D(g) be the domain of function “f” and “g” respectively. The domain in the case of function addition becomes.

D(f + g) = D(f) ? D(g)
Multiplication by a Scalar
Let f: X ? R be a real function and “k” be any scalar belonging to R. Then the product kf is a function from X to R defined by 

(kf)(x) = kf(x), x ? X
Multiplication of Two Real Functions
Let f : X ? R and g : X ? R be any two real functions, where X ? R. Then product of these two functions i.e. f ? g : X ? R is defined by

 (f × g) (x) = f (x) g (x) ? x ? X



Let D(f) and D(g) be the domain of function “f” and “g” respectively. In this case also the domain 

D(f ×  g) = D(f) ? D(g)

Quotient of Two Real Functions
Let f and g be two real functions defined from X ? R. The quotient of f by g is denoted by \frac{f}{g} is a function defined from X ? R as, 

(\frac{f}{g})(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, provided g(x) ? 0.



Let D(f) and D(g) be the domain of function “f” and “g” respectively. In this case also the domain 

Domain for \frac{f}{g}: {x | x ? Df ? Dg and g(x) ? 0}.Algebraic Operations on Complex Numbers.A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i represents the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation i² = ?1. For example, 5+6i is a complex number, where 5 is a real number and 6i is an imaginary number. Therefore, the combination of both the real number and imaginary number is a complex number. There can be four types of algebraic operations on complex numbers which are mentioned below.Algebraic Operations on Complex Numbers
The four operations on the complex numbers include:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division. Addition of Complex Numbers 
To add two complex numbers, just add the corresponding real and imaginary parts.

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i 
Subtraction of Complex Numbers 
To subtract two complex numbers, just subtract the corresponding real and imaginary parts.

(a + bi) ? (c + di) = (a ? c) + (b ? d)i 
Multiplication of Two Complex Numbers 
Multiplication of two complex numbers is the same as the multiplication of two binomials. Let us suppose that we have to multiply a + bi and c + di. We will multiply them term by term.

(a + bi) ? (c + di) = (a + bi) ? c + (a + bi) ? di


                              = (a ? c + (b ? c)i)+((a ? d)i + b ? d ? ?1)


                              = (a ? c ? b ? d + i(b ? c + a ? d))   
onjugate of a Complex Number 
In any two complex numbers, if only the sign of the imaginary part differs then, they are known as a complex conjugate of each other. Thus conjugate of a complex number a + bi would be a – bi.Polar Representation of Complex Numbers.Complex numbers, which take the form z = x + yi, can also be represented in a way that highlights their geometric properties. This alternative representation is known as the polar form. The polar representation of a complex number expresses it in terms of its magnitude (modulus) and direction (argument), offering a more intuitive understanding of its position in the complex plane.

In polar form, a complex number is written as z = r(cos?? + isin??), where:

r is the modulus, representing the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
? is the argument, indicating the angle between the positive real axis and the line segment joining the origin to (x, y).This form is particularly useful in various mathematical and engineering applications, such as simplifying the multiplication and division of complex numbers. By converting complex numbers from rectangular to polar form, operations involving these numbers become more manageable and visually intuitive.

Geometrical or Algebraic Form of a Complex Number
The complex number z = (x + i y) is represented by a point P (x, y) on the Argand plane, And every point on the Argand/Complex plane represents a unique complex number. If a complex number is purely real then it’s imaginary part Im(z) = 0 and it lies exactly on the real axis (X-axis), whereas a purely imaginary complex number has its real part Re(z) =0 and it lies exactly on the imaginary axis (Y-axis).


Note: If a point P (x, y) represents a complex number z on the Argand plane then the complex number Z = (x + i y) is known as the affix of the point P.
Polar or Trigonometrical Form of a Complex Number
We have seen the geometrical form of a complex number (z) in which it is represented by (x, y) on the Argand plane, OP = |z| and arg(z) = ?. Now we will use the geometrical form of a complex number to obtain its polar form. In the polar or trigonometrical form, the complex number (z) is represented by (r, ?). where r = |z| & ? = arg(z).
Absolute Value of a Complex Number.The absolute value, or modulus, of a complex number measures its distance from the origin on the complex plane. If you have a complex number z = a + ib, where a is the real part while ib is the imaginary part of the complex number in which i is known as iota and b is a real number. Then the absolute value of x is denoted as |z|.Real Number: A real number is a number that is present in the number system which can be positive, negative, integer, rational irrational, etc. For example, 23, -3, 3/6.
Imaginary Number: Imaginary numbers are those numbers that are not real numbers. For example, ?3, ?11, etc.
Zero Complex Number: A zero complex number is a number that has its real and imaginary parts both equal to zero. For example, 0+0i.Absolute Value of Complex Number
The absolute value(Modulus) of a number is the distance of the number from zero. Absolute value is always represented in the modulus(|z|) and its value is always positive. So, the absolute value of the complex number Z = a + ib is 

|z| = ? (a2 + b2).Proof of Absolute Value of Complex Numbers
Let us consider the mode of the complex number z is extended from 0 to z and the mod of a, b real numbers is extended from a to 0 and b to 0. So these values create a right angle triangle in which 0 is the vertex of the acute angle

So, using Pythagoras theorem, we get, 

|z|2 = |a|2 + |b|2

? |z| = ?(a2 + b2)

Now, in the sets of complex numbers z1 > z2 or z1 < z2 has no meaning but |z1| > |z2| or |z1| < |z2| has meaning because |z1| and |z2| is a real number. Properties of Modulus of a Complex Number
Some of the common properties of modulus of complex number are:

45,Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations,"Conjugate of Complex Numbers.Conjugate of Complex Number is a complex number obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part. In simple words, conjugate of a complex number is a number that has the same real part as the original complex number, and the imaginary part has the same magnitude but opposite sign.

In the world of mathematics, complex numbers are one of the most important discoveries by mathematicians as it helps us solve many real-life problems in various fields such as the study of electromagnetic waves, engineering, and physics.Complex Numbers is defined as a pair of real numbers and represented as a+ib, where a and b are the real numbers, and i = ?(-1) is called iota (an imaginary unit). Some Examples of Complex Numbers include (5 + 3 i), (0 + 7 i), (-4 + 9 i), (1 + 0 i), (0 – i), etc. Now, let’s discuss the conjugate of complex numbers or complex conjugates in detail.Conjugate of Complex Number Definition
Conjugate of a Complex Number is another complex number whose real parts Re(z) are equal and imaginary parts Im(z) are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Conjugate of a complex number z is represented by 
z

   while (z &

  ) together known as complex-conjugate pair because z and 
 
z

z are conjugate to each other. 

If z = x + iy is a complex number then the conjugate of z is defined as

  ? =x–iy  = x – iy. Properties of Conjugate
If z, z1, and z2 are complex numbers then below will be the conjugate properties.

Conjugate of a purely real complex number is the number itself (z =?z) i.e., conjugate of (7 + 0 i) = (7 – 0 i) = 7
Conjugate of a purely imaginary complex number is negative of that number (z + 
z
?
  
z
   = 0) i.e. conjugate of (0 -7 i) = (0 + 7 i) = 7 i.Multiplication of Complex Conjugate
The multiplication of complex conjugate is given below:

Let a+ib be a complex number then its conjugate will be a – ib.

Hence, the product of complex conjugate pair is given as (a + ib)(a – ib) = a2 – i2b2 = a2 + b2.Complex Conjugate Root Theorem
According to Complex Conjugate Root Theorem, if p(x) is a polynomial in which coefficients are real numbers and its root is a + ib then the conjugate of the root a – ib will also be the root of the polynomial.Imaginary Numbers.Imaginary numbers are numbers as the name suggests are the number that is not real numbers. All the numbers real and imaginary come under the categories of complex numbers. Imaginary numbers are very useful in solving quadratic equations and other equations whose solutions can not easily be found using general rules.Imaginary Numbers Definition
The number whose square results in negative results is called an Imaginary number.
In simple words, the square root of negative numbers is called an imaginary number. They are called imaginary numbers as we cannot associate them with any real-life examples.

They are represented by “i” and are pronounced as iota at its value is,

i = ?-1
What is Iota or “i”?
The term “iota” or “i” refers to the imaginary unit in mathematics. It is defined as the square root of -1, denoted by the symbol “i.”Value of i
In mathematical notation,

i 2= ?1 or i = ?(-1).The use of “i” allows mathematicians to extend the number system beyond real numbers, enabling solutions to equations that would otherwise be impossible to solve.Powers of i
We know that i2 = -1 and using the power rules other powers of I can also be easily calculated.

i = ?-1
i2 = -1
i3 = i2×i = -i
i4 = (i2)2 = (-1)2 = 1
i5 = i4×i = i.On observing clearly we can see a pattern, there is a cycle of  -i, 1, i… after power 2 thus,

i4n-1= -i
i4n = 1
i4n+1= i.Rules of Imaginary Number
Some of the important rules of Imaginary numbers are,

Imaginary numbers always exist in conjugate pairs i.e. for example if the complex number a + ib exists then its conjugate pair a – ib also exists.
Associating imaginary numbers with real values is impossible.
The square of the imaginary numbers results in a negative number which is the polar opposite of the real numbers, i.e. i2 = -1.Geometrical Interpretation of Imaginary Numbers
We usually represent a complex number a+bi by a point (a, b) in the Argand plane. For example, a complex number 5-6i is represented by the point (5, -6) on the Argand plane. 

Imaginary numbers in the form of bi (written as 0 + bi) are represented by the point (0, b) on the plane, and hence it is a point on the vertical axis (imaginary axis). Thus, the imaginary numbers always lie on the vertical axis of an Argand plane. Operations on Imaginary Numbers
We can perform basic arithmetic operations such as

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division.Addition of Imaginary Numbers
The addition of imaginary numbers can easily be achieved by using the basic rule of addition, i.e.

For two numbers, a+bi, and c+di when the addition is performed, then the real parts and the imaginary parts are added separately and then simplified.Subtraction of Imaginary Numbers
The subtraction of imaginary numbers can easily be achieved by using the basic rule of subtraction, i.e.

For two numbers, a+bi, and c+di when the subtraction is performed, then the real parts and the imaginary parts are subtracted separately and then simplified.Multiplication of Imaginary Numbers
The multiplication of imaginary numbers can easily be achieved by using the basic rule of multiplication and the distributive property of multiplication, i.e.

For two numbers, a+bi, and c+di the multiplication is explained with the help of the following example.Division of Imaginary Numbers
The division of imaginary numbers can easily be achieved by using the basic rule of division and finding the conjugate of the imaginary numbers.

For two numbers, a+bi, and c+di the division is explained with the help of the following example.Facts about Imaginary Numbers

46,Linear Inequalities,"Compound Inequalities.Compound Inequalities are the combination of two or more inequalities. These inequalities are combined using two conditions that are AND, and OR. These conditions have specific meanings and they are solved differently. The inequities in compound inequalities are individually solved using normal rules but the combinations of their answers depend on the AND and OR conditions. So, let’s start learning about the concept of compound inequalities including their solutions and various other solved examples as well.

What is Compound Inequality?

A compound inequality is an inequality that combines two simple inequalities by either the “AND” condition or the “OR” condition.The compound inequality with “AND” tells us that the condition is true when all the conditions in the compound inequality are true. Sometimes we do not even require to write AND and but it is understood. As in 2<x<4 it is nowhere written AND condition, but the above condition’s meaning is x>2 and x<4. AND is also called the intersection of the solution sets for the individual statements.

Whereas “OR” indicates that, as long as either of the one statements is true, the entire compound sentence is true. It is called the union of the solution sets for the individual statements.Compound Inequality Graph
Compound Inequality can be easily graphed in a coordinate plane and their solution is found using that. We should follow these points before graphing a compound inequality.

The number on the right-hand side of the inequality is marked on the number line as in x < 3. 3 is marked on the number line.
If the inequality is of the form <, and > we use an open bracket ( ) as it represents the number is not included. For example, in x < 3 we use the open bracket at 3 because it represents that 3 is not included in the inequality.
If the inequality is of the form ?, and ? we use a closed bracket [ ] as it represents the number is included. For example, in x ? 3 we use the closed bracket at 3 because it represents that 3 is included in the inequality.
If the”>” or “?” inequality is used we draw an arrow to the right side of the number in the number line.
If the “<” or “?” inequality is used, we draw an arrow to the left side of the number in the number line.
In the final solution, we take intersection when the AND condition is given and union when the OR condition is given.Example of Graphing Compound Inequality with OR
The graph of inequality with the “OR” condition is represented by the union condition i.e. if either one statement is true, the entire compound sentence is considered to be true. The condition “OR” when utilized in a compound inequality forms what’s referred to as a Disjunction. We take the union of both the solution in OR compound inequality.Example of Graphing Compound Inequality with AND
The graph of a compound inequality with the “AND” condition is represented by the intersection of the graph of the inequalities. The AND condition is true only when both conditions in the compound inequality are true. A compound inequality that uses the  “AND” is called a Conjunction. We take the intersection of both the solution in AND compound inequality.For solving the compound inequality follow the steps discussed below,

Step 1: Write the two inequalities individually from the compound inequalities.

Step 2: Solve each of the following inequality individually using the normal methods of solving inequalities.

Step 3: Mark the solution of both inequalities on the number line.

Step 4: If the compound condition is AND take the intersection of the solution and if the compounding is OR take the union of both the solution to get the desired solution of the inequalities.Algebraic Solutions of Linear Inequalities in One Variable and their Graphical Representation – Linear Inequalities A linear inequality is a mathematical expression involving an inequality symbol (<, >, ?, or ?) and a linear expression. Unlike linear equations, which give a specific solution, linear inequalities define a range of possible solutions.

Example: 2x+3>5

In this case, the inequality indicates that the values of

x which make this statement true are the solutions to this inequality.

Two algebraic expressions or real numbers related by the symbol ?, ?, < and > form an inequality. If the expressions are linear then the inequality is called linear inequality.  Eg : 4(x – 2) < 10, 10 < 45, x >= -3, etc.

Symbols of linear inequality:

Not Equal to (?)
Greater Than (>)
Less Than (<)
Greater Than or Equal To (?)
Less Than or Equal To (?).Strict and Slack Inequalities
Inequalities can be classified into two main types:

Strict Inequalities: These are inequalities that do not include the boundary value. Symbols: < (less than) and > (greater than).

Example: x>3 means

x can take any value greater than 3 but not 3 itself.

Slack Inequalities: These inequalities include the boundary value as part of the solution. Symbols: ? (less than or equal to) and ? (greater than or equal to).

Example: x?2 means

x can take any value greater than or equal to 2, including 2.Properties of Linear Inequality
We can add or subtract a real number from both sides of the inequality
We can multiply or divide both the sides of the inequality by a positive number
If we multiply or divide both the sides of the inequality by a negative number then the inequality sign gets reversed.Types of Linear Inequality
Linear Inequality in one variable: If the linear function involves a single variable then it is linear inequality in one variable. Eg: 2x – 45 > 7
Linear inequality in two variables: If the linear function involves two variables then it is linear inequality in two variables. Eg : 4x + 7y > 9.In this article, we will focus on Linear Inequalities in One Variable.

To solve linear inequality in one variable we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Separate the constants on one side and the variables on the other side.
Step 2: Simplify both the side to convert into an equation of the form mx > n or mx < n.
Step 3: Divide both the side by m, if m is negative then reverse the inequality sign.Graph of Linear Inequality in One Variable
As there is only one variable it will be represented on a number line. Steps for graphing a solution of a linear inequality on a number line:

Step 1: Solve the inequality

Step 2: Make a number line and plot the point on the number line

Step 3: Locate the real no. found after solving the inequality. Use an open circle for Strict Inequality(< and >) and a closed circle for Slack Inequality(? and ?)

Step 4: In the final inequality if the sign is > or ? draw the line towards the positive axis or towards the negative axis if the sign is < or ?.Graphical Solution of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables.We know how to formulate equations of different degree, and it is used a lot in real life, but the question arises, is it always possible to convert a situation into an equation? Sometimes we get statements like, the number of Covid cases per day in Delhi has reached more than 10,000. This phrase “Less than”, “Greater than”, “less than or equal to” etc. Such phrases are difficult to translate into equations. For such cases, we need to learn how to make equations with inequalities in them. Let’s see this in detail. What are Inequalities?
Let’s consider an example, Anil wants to buy some cold drinks. Each cold drink costs Rs 20, and he has a total of Rs 190 with him. Suppose he buys x cold drinks. What can be the maximum value of x? It can be represented in the form of an equation given below, 

20x < 190.Solutions of Inequalities
Any solution to an inequality is the value of that variable which makes inequality a true statement. For example, suppose we have an inequality x < 5. In such a case, all the values of x which are less than 5 make this inequality a true inequality. While solving inequalities we need to keep some rules in mind, 

Equal numbers can be added or subtracted from both sides of the inequality.
Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided) by the same positive number. But when both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number, then the sign of inequality is reversed.Graphical Representations of Inequalities in Two Variables 
We saw the graph of a linear inequality in one variable. A linear equation in two variables represents a line that divides the plane into two parts. We call each part a half-plane. If the line is vertical, it will divide the plane into the left half-plane and the right half-plane and the non-vertical line divide the plane into the upper left half-plane and lower half-plane. Solving Linear Inequalities Word Problems
We are well versed with equations in multiple variables. Linear Equations represent a point in a single dimension, a line in a two-dimensional, and a plane in a three-dimensional world. Solutions to linear inequalities represent a region of the Cartesian plane. It becomes essential for us to know how to translate real-life problems into linear inequalities. 

Linear Inequalities 
Before defining the linear inequalities formally, let’s see them through a real-life situation and observe why their need arises in the first place. Let’s say Albert went to buy some novels for himself at the book fair. He has a total of Rs 200 with him. The book fair has a special sale policy which offers any book at Rs 70. Now he knows that he may not be able to spend the full amount on the books. Let’s say x is the number of books he bought. This situation can be represented mathematically by the following equation, 

70x < 200

Since he can’t spend all the amount on books, and also the amount spent by him will always be less than Rs 200. The present situation can only be represented by the equation given above. Now let’s study the linear inequalities with a formal description, 

Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions which are related by symbols such as ‘>’, ‘<‘, ‘?’ and’?’ form the inequalities. Linear inequalities are formed by linear equations which are connected with these symbols. These inequalities can be further classified into two parts: 


Strict Inequalities: The inequalities with the symbols such as ‘>’ or ‘<‘.
Slack Inequalities: The inequalities with the symbols such as ‘?’ or ‘?’.Rules of Solving Linear Inequalities
There are certain rules which we should keep in mind while solving linear inequalities. 

Equal numbers can be added or subtracted from both sides of the inequality without affecting its sign.
Both sides of Inequality can be divided or multiplied by any positive number but when they are multiplied or divided by a negative number, the sign of the linear inequality is reversed.",0,0,1,0,0
47,Permutations and Combinations,"Fundamental Principle of Counting.Fundamental Principle of Counting is the basic principle that helps us to count large numbers in a non-tedious way. Suppose we have to guess the pin of a three-digit code so the number of ways we can guess is 1000 this can be seen as the pin can be, 000, 001, 002, ….., 999 any number between 000, and 999 including both numbers. Thus, there are a total of 1000 pin combinations.But using the fundamental principle of counting we can find the total number of possible combinations of the pins in a much simpler way, i.e. for the first place we have 10 different choices from 0-9, similarly for the second place we have 10 choices, and for the third place we have 10 choices. Now the total choices for the pin are 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000 which is much simpler to calculate than to count all possible combinations.So the fundamental principle of counting helps us to solve various problems of permutation and combination and helps us to make informed choices from all the available choices. In this article, we will learn about the fundamental principle of counting, multiplication rules, addition rules, and others in detail.Fundamental Principle of Counting
Fundamental Principle of Counting is very helpful in finding all the possible combinations in a particular situation. To understand this principle let’s consider an example. Say a person has 3 pairs of pants and 2 shirts and a question pops up, how many different ways are there in which can he dress? There are three different ways of choosing pants as there are three types of pants available. Similarly, there are two ways of choosing shirts.The fundamental principle of counting is studied under two headings that include,

Addition Rule
Multiplication Rule.Addition Rule
Addition Rule states that for two possible events A and B where A and B both are mutually exclusive events, i.e. they have no outcome in common and if event E is defined as occurring in either event A or event B then the possible number of ways in which event E can occur is,


n(E) = n(A) + n(B)
Where n(A), n(B), and n(E) are the number of events of A, B, and E respectively.Multiplication Rule
Multiplication Rule states that for “n” mutually independent events, P1, P2, P3, …Pn. The number of in which these events can occur is n(P1), n(P2), n(P3),… n(Pn) respectively. Now we define an event E such that it is happening all the events simultaneously then the number of ways this can happen is,


n(E) = n(P1) × n(P2) …….. × n(Pn).
This is called the multiplication rule of the Fundamental Principle of Counting.Permutation.In Mathematics, Permutation is defined as a mathematical concept that determines the number of possible arrangements for a specific set of elements. therefore, it plays a big role in computer science, cryptography, and operations research. Knowing the basics and formulae of permutation and combination helps in working out the total possible outcomes of many situations, from event planning to process optimization. Permutation is represented by the letter, P.What is a Permutation?
Permutation is defined as a mathematical concept that determines the number of possible arrangements for a specific set of elements. Simply put, it represents the different ways in which data can be ordered, typically taken from a list.Permutation Meaning in Maths
Permutation refers to every possible arrangement of n or lesser items from n available items.

In other words, arranging some objects in a specific order is called permutation. For example, we need to choose two numbers out of {1, 2, 3}, then there can be 6 ways in which we can do the same. (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (1, 3), and (3, 1). As we can see here both (1, 2) and (2, 1) are two different permutations, unlike combinations where (1, 2) and (2, 1) are the same combination.Representation of Permutation
There are various different representations of permutation, which mean the same thing. Some of the most common representations or notations are as follows:

P(n, r)
nPr
nPr
Pn, k.What is Factorial?
Factorial of a natural number n is denoted by the notation n! which represents the product of all natural numbers starting from 1 till n, including 1 and n. i.e. n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × (n-3) . . . × 1.

For example, If n = 3, then 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6, and If n = 5 then 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.Permutation Examples in Real Life
Some real-life examples of Permutation include password generation, seating arrangement, shuffling cards, phone numbers, lock combination, etc.Properties of Permutations
Some of the common properties of permutations are listed as follows:

nPn = n (n-1) (n-2) . . . 1 = n!.nP0 = n! / n! = 1
nP1 = n.nPn – 1 = n !
nPr / nPr-1 = n – r + 1
nPr =n × n-1Pr-1 = n × (n-1) × n-2Pr-2 = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × n-3Pr-3 = and so on.
n-1Pr + r × n-1Pr-1 = nPr.Permutation Formulas ( nPr ).Derivation of Permutation Formula
To derive the formula for permutation, we can use the first principle of counting and permutation in the following manner:

By the definition of permutation and principle of counting, we know


nPr = n × (n – 1)  . . .  (n – r + 1).Multiplying and Dividing by (n – r)! on the LHS, we get

nPr = n × (n – 1) × (n – 2) × . . . × (n – r + 1) × (n – r)! / (n – r)!

? nPr = n × (n – 1) × (n – 2) × . . . × (n – r + 1) × (n – r) × (n – r – 1) × . . . × 1 / (n – r)!

? nPr = n! / (n – r)! where  0 ? r ? n.Types of Permutation
In the study of permutation, there are some cases such as:

Permutation with Repetition
Permutation without Repetition
Permutation of Multi-Sets.Permutation With Repetition
This is the simplest of the lot. In such problems, the objects can be repeated. Let’s understand these problems with some examples.

Example: How many 3-digit numbers greater than 500 can be formed using 3, 4, 5, and 7?

Since a three-digit number, greater than 500 will have either 5 or 7 at its hundredth place, we have 2 choices for this place.

There is no restriction on repetition of the digits, hence for the remaining 2 digits we have 4 choices each

So the total permutations are,

2 × 4 × 4 = 32.Permutation Without Repetition
In this class of problems, the repetition of objects is not allowed. Let’s understand these problems with some examples.Permutation of Multi-Sets
Permutation when the objects are not distinct

This can be thought of as the distribution of n objects into r boxes where the repetition of objects is allowed and any box can hold any number of objects.

1st  box can hold n objects

2nd box can hold n objects

3rd box can hold n objects
.                                          . 
.                                          . 
.                                          . 

rth box can hold n objects

Hence total number of arrangements are,

n × n × n . . . (r times) = nr .Permutation and Combination
Permutation and Combination are the two most fundamental concepts in combinatorics, as these lay the foundation of this branch of mathematics. Combinatorics deals with all the mathematics which we need to solve problems based on selection, arrangement, and operation within a finite or discrete system.Relation Between nPr and nCr
We can understand nCr through the following analogy. Consider that we have n distinct boxes and r identical balls. (n > r)

The task is to place all the r balls into boxes such that no box contains more than 1 ball.

As all r objects are the same, the r! ways of arranging them can be considered as a single way.

To group all r! ways of arranging, we divide nPr by r!


nCr = nPr/r! = n!/{(n – r)! × r!}


Hence the relation between nPr and nCr is,


nCr = nPr/r!
Fundamental Counting Principle
Fundamental principle of the counting states that, “To perform a operation if we have m ways and to perform second operation if we have n different ways then to perform both the operation together there are m × n different ways.”

We can also extend the principle of counting for more operation such that, if for 1 operation we have m, 2 operation we have n, for third operation we have o, different ways respectively than, for performing all the operation together we have m × n × o ways.Permutation and Combinations Class 11
By understanding these above concepts and practicing various problems, you’ll be well-prepared to tackle questions on permutations and combinations in your Class 11 math exams.Problems on Permutation
Problem 1. How many 4-letter words, with or without meaning can be formed out of the letters of the word, ‘SATURDAY’ if repetition of letters is not allowed?.Combinations.Combination is a way of choosing items from a set, such as (unlike permutations) the order of selection doesn’t matter. In smaller cases, it’s possible to count the number of combinations. Combination refers to the mixture of n things taken k at a time without repetition.Combinations in Maths
Combination is the choice of selecting r things from a group of n things without replacement and where the order of selection is not important.

The number of combinations when ‘r’ elements are selected out of a complete set of ‘n’ elements is denoted by nCr

nCr = n! / [(r !) × (n – r)!].Combinations Meaning
Combinations refer to a way of selecting items from a larger set such that the order of selection does not matter.Basic Principles of Counting
Counting various things in a specific manner is a basic concern of mathematicians. To solve this problem two basic principles of counting are given which include:

Fundamental Principle of Counting: For any event X which occurs in n different ways and another event Y which occurs in m different ways. Then the total number of occurrences of two events is = m x n.
Addition Principle: For any event X which occurs in m different ways and event Y which occurs in n different ways where both events are implicit i.e. both the events cannot occur together, then the occurrence of events either X or Y is m + n.
Combinations Formula
Combination formula is used to pick r things out of n different things, where the order of picking is not important, and replacement is not allowed.Permutations and Combinations
Permutation and combination have a lot of similarities but they also have some striking differences. For n different objects, we have to make r unique selections from this group of n objects.

The number of permutations of size r from n object is nPr here the order, of selection is not important so each selection is counted r! times. So the number of unique selections is nPr / r! We know that a unique selection of r things from the total of n things is called a combination (nCr). Thus,

nCr = nPr / r!.Relatioship Between Permutation and Combination
The main relatioship between Permutation and Combination are added below:

Permutation: Permutation involves arranging items in a specific order, considering the arrangement’s significance. For example, arranging letters to form words or seating people in a row.
Combination: Combination, on the other hand, focuses on selecting items from a set without regard to their order. It emphasizes the group of items chosen rather than their arrangement. For example, selecting a committee from a pool of candidates or choosing lottery numbers.What is Handshaking Problem?
Handshaking problem is one of the most interesting problems in mathematics. It is used to find that in a room full of people how many handshakes are required for everybody to shake everybody else’s hand exactly once?.Handshaking Combination
It means the total number of people in a room doing the handshake with each other. With the help of combination formulas, it can easily be calculated. The formula for calculating the handshakes when there are n people available is given by,

48,Binomial Theorem,"Binomial Theorem.Binomial Theorem is a theorem that is used to find the expansion of algebraic identity (ax + by)n. We can easily find the expansion of (x + y)2, (x + y)3, and others but finding the expansion of (x + y)21 is a tedious task and this task can easily be achieved using the Binomial Theorem or Binomial Expansion.

Binomial theorem is used to find the expansion of two terms hence it is called the Binomial Theorem. The exponent value in the Binomial expansion can also be a negative value or fraction value.

We have explained about Binomial Theorem formula, Binomial Theorem proof, and Binomial Theorem examples in detail below.What is the Binomial Theorem?
Binomial theorem is a fundamental principle in algebra that describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. According to this theorem, the expression (? + ?)? where ? and ? are any numbers and ? is a non-negative integer. It can be expanded into the sum of terms involving powers of ? and ?.Binomial theorem is used to solve binomial expressions simply. This theorem was first used somewhere around 400 BC by Euclid, a famous Greek mathematician.

It gives an expression to calculate the expansion of algebraic expression (a+b)n. The terms in the expansion of the following expression are exponent terms and the constant term associated with each term is called the coefficient of terms.

Binomial Theorem Statement
Binomial theorem for the expansion of (a+b)n is stated as,


(a + b)n = nC0 anb0 + nC1 an-1 b1 + nC2 an-2 b2 + …. + nCr an-r br + …. + nCn a0bn.where n > 0 and the nCk is the binomial coefficient.Binomial Expansion Formula
Binomial theorem formula gives the expansion of the algebraic identities in the form of a series. This formula is used to find the expansion up to n terms of the (a+b)n. The binomial expansion of (a + b)n can easily be represented with the summation formula.

Binomial Theorem Formula for the expansion of (a + b)n is,


(a + b)n = ?nr nCr an-r br


where,

n is a positive integer,
a, b are real numbers, and 0 < r ? n.We can easily find the expansion of the various identities such as (x+y)7, (x+9)11, and others using the Binomial Theorem Formula. We can also find the expansion of (ax + by)n using the Binomial Theorem Formula,

Expansion formula for (ax + by)n is,


(ax + by)n = ?nr nCr (ax)n-r (by)r
Binomial Expansion Formula

nCr = n! / [r! (n – r)!]
Binomial Theorem Proof
We can easily proof Binomial Theorem Expansion using the concept of Principle of Mathematical Induction

Let’s take x, a, n ? N, and then the Binomial Theorem says that,

(x+y)n = nC0 xny0 + nC1 xn-1y1 + nC2 xn-2 y2 + … + nCn-1 x1yn-1 + nCn x0yn.Binomial Expansion
Binomial Theorem is used to expand the algebraic identity (x + y)n. Hence it is also called the binomial expansion. The binomial expansion of (x + y)n with the help of the binomial theorem is,


(x+y)n = nC0 xny0 + nC1 xn-1y1 + nC2 xn-2 y2 + … + nCn-1 x1yn-1 + nCnx0yn .Using this expansion we get each term in the expansion of (x+y)nl.Properties of Binomial Theorem
There are various properties related to the binomial theorem, some of those properties are as follows:

Number of Terms: In the binomial Expansion of (x + y)n using the binomial theorem, there are n+1  terms and coefficients.
First and last terms in the binomial expansion of (x + y)n are xn and yn, respectively.
General Term: In the binomial expansion of (x + y)n the general term can be represented as T(r + 1) and is given by T(r + 1) = nCr × x(n-r) × yr.
Pascal’s Triangle: The binomial coefficients in the expansion are arranged in Pascal’s triangle which is the pattern of number where each number is the sum of the two numbers above it.
 Specific Values: When n is a non-negative integer, the expansion simplifies for specific values of n:
(a + b)0 = 1
(a + b)1 = a + b
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3
and so on…Binomial Coefficients Symmetry: In the binomial expansion of (x + y)n, the rth term from the end is the (n – r + 2)th term from the beginning.
If n is even, then in the expansion of (x + y)n, the middle term is ((n/2) + 1). If n is odd, then the middle terms are ((n + 1)/2) and ((n + 3)/2) in the expansion of (x + y)n.
Pascal’s Triangle Binomial Expansion
The number associated with the terms of the binomial expansion is called the coefficient of the binomial expansion. These variables can easily be found using Pascal’s Triangle or by using combination formulas.

Binomial Theorem Coefficients
After examining the coefficient of the various terms in the expansion of algebraic identities using the binomial theorem, we have observed a trend in the coefficient of the terms of the expansion. The trend is that the coefficient of the terms in the expansion of the binomial terms is directly similar to the rows of the Pascal triangle.

For example, the coefficient of each term in the expansion of the (x+y)4 is directly equivalent to the terms in the 4th row of the Pascal Triangle.

Now, let’s learn about Pascal Triangle in detail.

Pascal Triangle
Pascal Triangle is an alternative method of the calculation of coefficients that come in binomial expansions, using a diagram rather than algebraic methods.

In the diagram shown below, it is noticed that each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. This pattern continues indefinitely to obtain coefficients of any index of the binomial expression.Combinations
The combination formulas are also widely used to find coefficients of the various terms in the expansion of the binomial theorem.

The combination formula used for choosing r objects out of n total objects is widely used in the binomial expansion and it is defined as,


nCr = n! / [r! (n – r)!]
Also, some common combination formulas used in the Binomial Expansion are,

nCn = nC0 = 1
nC1 = nCn-1 = n
nCr = nCr-1.Binomial Expansion for Negative Exponent
Binomial theorem is also used for finding the expansion of the identities which have negative exponents. The coefficients terms in the negative expansion are similar in magnitude to the terms in the corresponding positive exponent.

Some of the simplified expansions of the negative exponents which are widely used are,

(1 + x)-1 = 1 – x + x2 – x3 + x4 – x5 + …….
(1 – x)-1 = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + …….
(1 + x)-2 = 1 – 2x + 3x2 – 4x3 + ……..
(1 – x)-2 = 1 + 2x + 3x2 + 4x3 + ……..General Term of Expansion
The general term of the binomial expansion signifies a term that produces all the terms of the binomial expansion by simply replacing the value of one component of the term.

For example in the binomial expansion of (x+y)n the general term is,


Tr+1 = nCr xn-ryr


Where, 0 ? r ?n
Middle Term of Expansion
We know that the total number of terms in the expansion of (x + y)n is n + 1. And so the middle term in the binomial expansion of the (x+y)n depends on the value of n. The value of n can be either even or odd which decides the number/numbers and values of the middle term.

If n is even then we have odd (n+1) terms in the expansion of (x+y)n. Thus, there is one middle term, in this case, and the middle term is (n/2 + 1)th term.
If n is odd then we have even (n+1) terms in the expansion of (x+y)n. Thus, there are two middle terms, in this case, and the middle terms are the (n/2)th term and (n/2 + 1)th term.
Learn More: General and Middle Terms.Identifying a Particular Term in Expansion
Any particular term can easily be identified in the expansion of (x+y)n. We follow two steps to get a particular term in the expansion of (x+y)n.Term Independent of X in Expansion
The term independent of ‘x’ can easily be identified in the expansion of (x+y)n. We follow two steps to get a particular term in the expansion of (x+y)n.Numerically Greatest Term of Expansion
We can easily find the numerically greatest term in the expansion of (1+x)n. The formula to find the greatest term in the expansion of (1+x)n is,


[(n+1)|x|]/(1+|x|).While using this formula we have to make sure that the expansion is in (1+x)n form only, and |x| gives only the numerical value.

Applications of Binomial Theorem
The Binomial Theorem has various applications it is used for a variety of the purposes such as,

Finding Remainder in the division of very large numbers.
Finding Last Digits of a Number
Checking the Divisibility
Finding Remainder using Binomial Theorem
This can easily be understood with the help of the following example.

Example: Find the remainder when 297 is divided by 15

Solution:


(297 / 15) = [2(24)24 / 15)] 


= [2(15 + 1)24 / 15]


As each term of the expansion of (1 + 15)24 contains 15 except the first term which is only 1.


Thus, Remainder when 297 is divided by 15 is 1.Binomial Theorem for Any Index
Binomial Theorem for any index, including non-integer and negative indices, generalizes the familiar binomial expansion that applies to positive integer exponents.

This generalized form involves the use of binomial coefficients that are defined for any real number index using the concept of factorial functions extended to the gamma function for non-integer values.

Multinomial Theorem
We know that the binomial theorem expansion of (x + a)n is,


(x+a)n = n?r nCr xn – r ar


Where n?N.We can generalize this result to get the expansion of,

(x1 + x2 + … +xk)n = ?(r1 + r2 + …. + rk = n) [n! / r1!r2!…rk!] x1r1 x2r2 …xkrk

The general term in the above expansion is

 [n! / r1!r2!…rk!] x1r1 x2r2 …xkrk.The number of terms in the above expansion is equal to the number of non-negative integral solutions of the equation r1 + r2 + … + rk = n

Each solution of this equation gives a term in the above multinomial expansion. The total number of solutions can be given by n + k – 1Ck ?1.Binomial Distribution and Binomial Coefficients
Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent and identical Bernoulli trials (experiments with two possible outcomes: success or failure). It’s characterized by two parameters: nn (the number of trials) and pp (the probability of success in each trial).

Hypergeometric Distribution
The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of obtaining a specific number of successes in a sample of a fixed size drawn without replacement from a finite population containing a known number of successes and failures.Pascal’s Triangle.Pascal’s Triangle is a numerical pattern arranged in a triangular form. This triangle provides the coefficients for the expansion of any binomial expression, with numbers organized in a way that they form a triangular shape. i.e. the second row in Pascal’s triangle represents the coefficients in (x+y)2 and so on.

In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the above two numbers. Pascal’s triangle has various applications in probability theory, combinatorics, algebra, and various other branches of mathematics.

Let us learn more about Pascal’s triangle, Its construction, and various patterns in Pascal’s Triangle in detail in this article.What is Pascal’s Triangle?
It is named after the famous Philosopher and Mathematician Balise ‘Pascal’ who developed a pattern of numbers starting with 1 and the numbers beneath are the summation of the above numbers. First, write down the number 1 to start making Pascal’s triangle. The second row is written down by two 1s again. Other rows are generated using the previous rows to make a triangle of numbers. Each row begins and ends with a 1.What is Pascal’s Triangle?
We define the Pascal triangle as the basic set of numbers arrange in a triangular array such that each element in Pascal’s triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Pascal’s triangle starts with 1  and this was first proposed by the famous French mathematician Balise Pascal and hence named Pascal’s Triangle.

This triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion for various powers. (we have to make sure that the power in the binomial expansion is only a natural number then only Pascal’s triangle represents the coefficients in the binomial expansion).Pascal’s Triangle Definition

Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two directly above it.Pascal’s Triangle Construction
We can easily construct the Pad=scal’s triangle by just adding the two numbers of the above row to get the next number in the row below. We can assume that the zeroth row starts with a single element 1 and then the element in the second row is 1 1 which is formed by adding 1+0 and 1+0. Similarly, the elements in the second row are, 1 2 1 2hich are formed by adding, 1+0, 1+1, and 1+0, and thus the elements in the third row are obtained. Expanding this concept to the nth row we get a Pascal’s Triangle with n+1 rows. Pascal’s Triangle Formula
Pascal Triangle Formula is the formula that is used to find the number that is to be filled in the mth column and the nth row. As we know that the terms in Pascal’s triangle are the summation of the terms in the above row. So we require the elements in the (n-1)th row, and (m-1)th and nth columns to get the required number in the mth column and the nth row.

Read in Detail: Pascal’s Triangle Formula

The elements of the nth row of Pascal’s triangle are given, nC0, nC1, nC2, …, nCn. 

The formula for finding any number in Pascal’s triangle is:


nCm = n-1Cm-1 + n-1Cm


Where,


nCm represents the (m+1)th element in the nth row., and
n is a non-negative integer [0 ? m ? n].Pascal’s Triangle Binomial Expansion
We can easily find the coefficient of the binomial expansion using Pascal’s Triangle. The elements in the (n+1)th row of the Pascal triangle represent the coefficient of the expanded expression of the polynomial (x + y)n.Pascal’s Triangle Patterns
We observe various patterns in Pascal’s triangle they are:

Addition of Rows
Prime Numbers in Triangle
Diagonals in Pascal’s Triangle
Fibonacci Pattern.Addition of Rows
On close observing Pascal’s Triangle we can conclude that the sum of any row in Pascal’s triangle is equal to a power of 2. The formula for the same is, For any (n+1)th row in Pascal’s Triangle the sum of all the elements is, 2n.Prime Numbers in Pascal’s Triangle
Another very interesting pattern in the Pascals triangle is that if a row starts with a prime number (neglecting 1 at the start of each row), then all the elements in that row are divisible by that prime number. This pattern does not hold true for the composite numbers. 

For example, the eighth row in the Pascal triangle is,

1    7    21    35    35    21    7    1

Here, all the elements are divisible by 7.

For rows starting with composite numbers such as the fifth row,

1    4    6    4    1

The pattern does not hold true as 4 does not divide 6.

Diagonals in Pascal’s Triangle
Each rightward diagonal of Pascal’s Triangle, when considered as a sequence represents the different numbers such as the first rightward diagonal represents a sequence of number 1, the second rightward diagonal represents triangular numbers, the third rightward diagonal represents the tetrahedral numbers, the fourth rightward diagonal represents the Penelope numbers and so on.Fibonacci Sequence in Pascal’s Triangle
We can easily obtain the Fibonacci sequence by simply adding the numbers in the diagonals of Pascal’s triangle.Pascal’s Triangle Properties
Various Properties of Pascal’s Triangle are,

Every number in the Pascal triangle is the sum of the number above it.
The starting and the end number in Pascal’s triangle are always 1.
The first diagonal in Pascal’s Triangle represents the natural number or counting numbers.
The sum of elements in each row of Pascal’s triangle is given using a power of 2.
Elements in each row are the digits of the power of 11.
The Pascal triangle is a symmetric triangle.
The elements in any row of Pascal’s triangle can be used to represent the coefficients of Binomial Expansion.
Along the diagonal of Pascal’s Triangle, we observe the Fibonacci numbers.",0,0,1,0,0
49,Sequences and Series,"Sequences and Series: In mathematics, the sequence is a collection or list of numbers that have a logical/sequential order or pattern between them. For example, 1, 5, 9, 13, … is a sequence having a difference of 4 between each consecutive next term and each term can be represented in form 1 + 4 * ( n – 1 ) where n is the nth term of the sequence. The sequence can be classified into 3 categories:

Arithmetic Sequence
Geometric Sequence
Harmonic Sequence.What are Sequences and Series?
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers that follow a specific pattern or rule. Each number in the sequence is called a term. Sequences can be finite or infinite, depending on whether they have a limited number of terms or continue indefinitely. The pattern or rule that defines a sequence can be arithmetic, geometric, or based on some other mathematical relationship.

Arithmetic Sequence
The sequence in which each consecutive term has a common difference and this difference could be positive, negative and even zero is known as an arithmetic sequence.Geometric Sequence
The sequence in which each consecutive term has a common ratio is known as a Geometric sequence.Harmonic Sequence
The sequence in which the reciprocal of each term forms an arithmetic sequence is known as a harmonic sequence.What is Summation Notation?
Summation Notation is a simple method to find the sum of a sequence. Summation notation is also known as sigma notation. Sigma refers to the Greek letter sigma, ?. The limit of the sequence is represented as shown in figure 1 where the lower limit is the starting index of the sequence and the upper limit represents the ending index of the sequence. Like as shown in figure 1 the lower limit is 1 and the upper limit is 4 so this means we need the sum of 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th term which is ( 2 * 1 ) + ( 2 * 2 ) + ( 2 * 3 ) + ( 2 * 4 ) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.Summation Notation: ? n = 1 4 ( 2 ? n ) n=1 ? 4 ? (2?n).Summation Notation for Arithmetic Sequence
Summation Notation of Arithmetic Sequence is of form  ? (a + b * n) where a is the first term of the sequence and b is the common difference between any two consecutive terms of the sequence and therefore the nth term of the sequence would be of the form (a + (b * n)).Summation Notation for Geometric Sequence
Summation Notation of Geometric Sequence is of form  ? (a * bn) where a is the first term of the sequence and b is the common ratio between any two consecutive terms of the sequence and therefore the nth term of the sequence would be of the form (a * bn). Geometric Summation Notation: .Summation Notation for Harmonic Sequence
Summation Notation of Harmonic Sequence is of form  ? ( 1/(a + b*n) )where a is the reciprocal of the first term of the sequence and b is the common difference between reciprocal any two consecutive terms of the sequence and therefore the nth term of the sequence would be of the form (1/(a + b * n)). Harmonic Summation Notation: General and Middle Terms – Binomial Theorem.Binomial theorem or expansion describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. According to this theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial “(a + b)n“ into a sum involving terms of the form “axzyc“, the exponents z and c are non-negative integers where z + c = n, and the coefficient of each term is a positive integer depending on the values of n and b. 
Arithmetic Series.An ordered list of numbers is called a sequence. Each number in the sequence is called a term. The sequence usually has patterns that allow us to predict what the next term of the sequence will be. An arithmetic series is the sum of sequences in which each term is computed from the previous one by adding and subtracting a constant. Or we can say that an arithmetic progression can be defined as a sequence of numbers in which for every pair of consecutive terms, the second number is found by adding a constant number to the previous one. ,
In Arithmetic Series/Progression, we come across three terms which are: 
Common difference(d)
nth term(an)
Sum of the first n terms(Sn).Here, all the above three terms represent the property of the arithmetic progression. 
To find the common difference in the arithmetic progression the following procedure is followed: 
 d = a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = a4 – a3….. = an-an-1.where,
a1, a2, a3….an  are the terms of the series
“d” is a common difference which can be positive, negative or zero
Also, an arithmetic progression can also be written in the form of common difference as shown below: 

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ………. , a + (n – 1)d
Where, “a” is the first term of series. There are two major formulas while reading arithmetic progression: 
nth term of Arithmetic Series 
Sum of first n Terms 
nth term of Arithmetic Series.The formula for nth term is,


an = a + (n?1)d


where,


a is the first term
d is the common difference
n is the number of terms
an is the nth term.Sum of First n Terms
The sum of first “n” terms of the series can be easily found is we know the first term of the series and total terms. The formula for finding the sum of first “n” terms is: 
Sn = n/2 [2a + (n?1)d]
where,a is the first term 
d is the common difference 
n is the number of terms.Arithmetic Series Sigma Notation
Sigma notation looks like the below: 

?Fn=i [expression]

Here in the above expression the ‘i’ describes the initial value. The ‘f’ describes the final value and the expression refers for the function and the ‘E’ symbol is the Greek symbol called sigma. Arithmetic Series Sum Expression
When we get the arithmetic series expression like below: 

1 + 5 + 9 +……+ 45 

Now here we know that the expression for summation is as follows: 

Sn = n/2(a1 + an)

Here we know the value 

a1 = 1
an = 45
d = (5-1) = 4.Arithmetic Series Recursive Formula
Recursive Formula gives to two information:

First term of the sequence 
Pattern rule to find any term from the term that comes before it 
Suppose, we have the series 3, 5, 7….. then here the first term of the series is a1 = 3 Now, from above the series we see that the formula for an Will be as below: 

If a1 = 3 than an = a(n-1) + 2

Therefore, we have to add ‘2’ to the previous term to get to next term of the series. Hence, finding the rest of the term below: 

a1 = 3
a2 = a1+2 = 3 + 2 = 5
a3 = a2 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
a4 = a3 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
a5 = a4 + 2 = 11… and so on.Proof of Finite Arithmetic Series Formula
As we know that,

Sn = n/2(a1 + an)

As we know at Sn  is the sum of the arithmetic series of ‘n’ terms, therefore, we can display it like below: 

Sn = 1 + 2 + 3….+ (n-1) + n

Sn = n + (n-1) +…+ 3 + 2 + 1 

Adding both the Sn series we get the following result: 

 2Sn = n+1 + 2+(n-1) + 3+(n-2)…..

2Sn = n(n+1)

Sn = n(n+1)/2

In the above formula, we find that sum of every term on the left-side turn out to be ‘n+1’ for ‘n’ times. 
Hence, we have proved,


Sn = n(n+1)/2 .Arithmetic Sequence is a type of sequence out of all sequences where each term of the sequence is related to the previous term of the sequence by a linear relation. A sequence is a collection of objects where all the terms follow an order or pattern by which the whole sequence can be identified. In the case of an Arithmetic Sequence, each term can be found by adding a constant to the preceding term of the Arithmetic Sequence, this constant sets the Arithmetic Sequence apart from the other sequences.What is Arithmetic Sequence?
In the arithmetic sequence, the absolute difference between one term and the next term is constant. In other words, a sequence a1, a2, . . ., an is called an arithmetic sequence or arithmetic progression if an+1 – an = d where d is constant and it is the common difference of the sequence.


Let’s make a general example of an Arithmetic Progression as follows:


a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, . . .


Where 


a is the first term of Arithmetic Sequence
d is a common difference between any two consecutive terms of Arithmetic Sequence.Arithmetic Sequence Definition

An arithmetic sequence, also known as an arithmetic progression, is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.
Arithmetic Sequence Formula
As we already discussed that the arithmetic sequence is a series of numbers where each number is calculated by adding a constant in the previous term. There are various formulas that are used in the Arithmetic sequence that are,

Nth Term of Arithmetic Sequence
Recursive Formula for Arithmetic Sequence
Sum of terms in Arithmetic Sequence
Nth Term of Arithmetic Sequence
Let’s consider an example of Arithmetic Sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, . . .. In general, this is the standard explicit formula of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is, A, end, and the common difference is D is given as follows:
an = a + (n-1)×d
Recursive Formula for Arithmetic Sequence
The nth term of an Arithmetic Sequence can be defined recursively as the next term can always be obtained by adding a common difference to the preceding term, the following derivation can be used to illustrate the same thing.
Sum of terms in Arithmetic Sequence
Let’s sequence is given as a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ….. a+(n-1)d.


Sn = (n/2)(a + l) 


where,


a is the first term
l is the last term of the series and 
n is the number of terms in the series. Replacing the last term l by the nth term = a + (n – 1)d, we get
Sn = (n/2)(a + a + (n – 1)d)
OR
Sn = (n/2)(2a + (n – 1) x d).Properties of Arithmetic Sequence
There are some properties of Arithmetic Sequence, some of which are as follows:

If a constant is added or subtracted to each term of an Arithmetic Sequence then the resulting sequence is also an Arithmetic Sequence.
If each term of an Arithmetic Sequence is multiplied or divided (not by 0) by a constant number. Then the resulting sequence is also an Arithmetic Sequence.
For any three consecutive terms of an Arithmetic Sequence sum of the first and last term is always twice the middle term.
We can observe a symmetry about the mean in the arithmetic sequence.
An arithmetic sequence can be extended to infinity by adding a common difference to the last term.Geometric Progression (GP) | Formula, Sums and Properties.Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio.

Example: GP = 2,4,8,16,32,64……What is Geometric Progression (GP)?
Geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.Condition for the given sequence to be a geometric sequence:
For any sequence to be considered a GP the ratio of two any successive terms must remain constant:

a2/a1 = a3/a2 =  … = an/an-1 = r (common ratio).General Form of Geometric Progression
The given sequence can also be written as:

a, ar, ar2, ar3, … , arn-1  

Here, r is the common ratio and a is the scale factor.Common ratio of Geometric Series is given by:
 Geometric Progression Sum of N Terms
The geometric progression summation is given by

S = a1 + a2 + a3 + … + an.Sum of Infinite of Geometric Progression
The number of terms in infinite geometric progression will approach infinity (n = ?). The sum of infinite geometric progression can only be defined at the ratio of |r| < 1.Geometric Sequence Recursive Formula
A recursive formula defines the terms of a sequence in relation to the previous value. As opposed to an explicit formula, which defines it in relation to the term number.Geometric Series is a type of series where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In mathematics, a geometric series is the sum of an infinite number of terms that have a constant ratio between successive terms.

Geometric series are characterized by their exponential growth or decay patterns. This growth or decay depends on whether the common ratio is greater than or less than one. In this article, we will discuss geometric series in detail including formulas as well as the derivation of the formula.What is a Geometric Series?
In a Geometric Series, every next term is the multiplication of its Previous term by a certain constant, and depending upon the value of the constant, the Series may increase or decrease.Geometric Series Definition
A geometric series is the sum of the terms of a geometric sequence, a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.Derivation for Geometric Series Formula
Suppose a Geometric Series for n terms: 

Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + …. + arn-1 . . . (1)

Multiplying both sides by the common factor (r):

r Sn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + … + arn . . . (2)Subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (2):

(r Sn – Sn) = (ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 +. . . arn) – (a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + . . . + arn-1).Geometric Mean
By definition, it is the nth root of the Product of n numbers where ‘n’ denotes the number of terms present in the series. Geometric Mean differs from the Arithmetic Mean as the latter is obtained by adding all terms and dividing by ‘n’, while the former is obtained by doing the product and then taking the mean of all the terms.Arithmetic Progression and Geometric Progression: The word “sequence” in English means a collection of some numbers or objects in such a way that it has a first member, a second member, and so on. Sequences can be of anything, for example. – January, February, …. is the sequence of months in a year. Sequences come into use in actual real lives of people every day. Days of a week can also be considered as a sequence. Thus, it becomes essential to study the sequences and find patterns in them to predict the sequence’s next terms and extract information from them. Sequences
Let’s consider a sequence: 2,4,6,8 and so on. The various numbers occurring in it are called its terms. They are denoted by a1, a2, a3 … an.  The subscripts denote the nth term. The nth term of the sequence is also called the general term of the sequence because we can derive every other term from it by putting different values of n. Here in this case, 

a1 = 2, a2 = 4, a3 = 6 and so on…Series
For a given sequence a1, a2, a3 … an. The expression given below is called a series. A series can be infinite or finite depending upon the number of terms its sequence has. ? is the common notation used to denote the series. This indicates the summation involved. What is Arithmetic Progression (A.P)
Consider a sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, ….. Notice that in this sequence, the difference between successive terms is constant. This means that at each step a constant value is being added to each term of this sequence. A sequence a1, a2, a3 … an can be called an arithmetic progression if an+1 = an + d where n is any natural number. In such a series, a1 is called the first term, and the constant term d is called the common difference of A.P. So, an AP looks like, 

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d ….. and so on. 
Special Series: A series can be defined as the sum of all the numbers of the given sequence. The sequences are finite as well as infinite. In the same way, the series can also be finite or infinite. For example, consider a sequence as 1, 3, 5, 7, … Then the series of these terms will be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ….. The series special in some way or the other is called a special series. The following are the three types of special series.1 + 2 + 3 +… + n (sum of first n natural numbers)
12 + 22 + 32 +… + n2 (sum of squares of the first n natural numbers)
13 + 23 + 33 +… + n3 (sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers).What are Special Series?
Special series in mathematics refers to specific sequences of numbers or terms that follow a particular pattern or rule and are widely studied for their unique properties and applications. These series include well-known examples like the arithmetic series, geometric series, harmonic series, and Fibonacci series.

50,Computer Systems and Organisation,"Introduction to Computer System.CPU [Central Processing Unit]. It is the brain of the computer. It is the part that does most of the work in a computer system. Just like how our brain controls our body and processes information, the CPU carries out instructions from programs and performs calculations. It’s made up of smaller components that work together to execute tasks, making it the heart of any computing device.

All types of data processing operations from simple arithmetic to complex tasks and all the important functions of a computer are performed by the CPU. It helps input and output devices to communicate with each other and perform their respective operations. It also stores data which is input, intermediate results in between processing, and instructions. The CPU’s job is to make sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. In this article, we are going to discuss CPU in detail.What is a CPU?
A Central Processing Unit is the most important component of a computer system. A CPU is hardware that performs data input/output, processing, and storage functions for a computer system. A CPU can be installed into a CPU socket. These sockets are generally located on the motherboard. CPU can perform various data processing operations. CPU can store data, instructions, programs, and intermediate results.History of CPU
Since 1823, when Baron Jons Jakob Berzelius discovered silicon, which is still the primary component used in manufacturing CPUs today, the history of the CPU has experienced numerous significant turning points. The first transistor was created by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley in December 1947. in 1958, the first working integrated circuit was built by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby.The Intel 4004 was the company’s first microprocessor, which it unveiled in 1971. Ted Hoff’s assistance was needed for this. When Intel released its 8008 CPU in 1972, Intel 8086 in 1976, and Intel 8088 in June 1979, it contributed to yet another win. The Motorola 68000, a 16/32-bit processor, was also released in 1979. The Sun also unveiled the SPARC CPU in 1987. AMD unveiled the AM386 CPU series in March 1991.

In January 1999, Intel introduced the Celeron 366 MHZ and 400 MHz processors. AMD back in April 2005 with its first dual-core processor. Intel also introduced the Core 2 Dual processor in 2006. Intel released the first Core i5 desktop processor with four cores in September 2009.

In January 2010, Intel released other processors like the Core 2 Quad processor Q9500, the first Core i3 and i5 mobile processors, and the first Core i3 and i5 desktop processors.

In June 2017, Intel released Core i9 desktop processor, and Intel introduced its first Core i9 mobile processor In April 2018.Different Parts of CPU
Now, the CPU consists of 3 major units, which are:

Memory or Storage Unit
Control Unit
ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit)Memory or Storage Unit
As the name suggests this unit can store instructions, data, and intermediate results. The memory unit is responsible for transferring information to other units of the computer when needed. It is also known as an internal storage unit or the main memory or the primary storage or Random Access Memory (RAM) as all these are storage devices.

Its size affects speed, power, and performance. There are two types of memory in the computer, which are primary memory and secondary memory. Some main functions of memory units are listed below:

Data and instructions are stored in memory units which are required for processing.
It also stores the intermediate results of any calculation or task when they are in process.
The final results of processing are stored in the memory units before these results are released to an output device for giving the output to the user.
All sorts of inputs and outputs are transmitted through the memory unit.Control Unit
As the name suggests, a control unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but it does not carry out any data processing operations. Executing already stored instructions, It instructs the computer by using the electrical signals to instruct the computer system. It takes instructions from the memory unit and then decodes the instructions after that it executes those instructions. So, it controls the functioning of the computer. Its main task is to maintain the flow of information across the processor. Some main functions of the control unit are listed below:

Controlling of data and transfer of data and instructions is done by the control unit among other parts of the computer.
The control unit is responsible for managing all the units of the computer.
The main task of the control unit is to obtain the instructions or data that is input from the memory unit, interpret them, and then direct the operation of the computer according to that.
The control unit is responsible for communication with Input and output devices for the transfer of data or results from memory.
The control unit is not responsible for the processing of data or storing data.ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) 
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical functions or operations. It consists of two subsections, which are:

Arithmetic Section: By arithmetic operations, we mean operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and all these operations and functions are performed by ALU. Also, all the complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the mentioned operations by ALU.
Logic Section: By Logical operations, we mean operations or functions like selecting, comparing, matching, and merging the data, and all these are performed by ALU.What Does a CPU Do?
The main function of a computer processor is to execute instructions and produce an output. CPU work Fetch, Decode, and Execute are the fundamental functions of the computer.

Fetch: the first CPU gets the instruction. That means binary numbers that are passed from RAM to CPU.3. Optical Disks: It’s a laser-based storage medium that can be written to and read. It is reasonably priced and has a long lifespan. The optical disc can be taken out of the computer by occasional users.

Types of Optical Disks

CD – ROM

It’s called compact disk. Only read from memory.
Information is written to the disc by using a controlled laser beam to burn pits on the disc surface.
It has a highly reflecting surface, which is usually aluminium.
The diameter of the disc is 5.25 inches.
16000 tracks per inch is the track density.
The capacity of a CD-ROM is 600 MB, with each sector storing 2048 bytes of data.
The data transfer rate is about 4800KB/sec. & the new access time is around 80 milliseconds.
WORM-(WRITE ONCE READ MANY)

A user can only write data once.
The information is written on the disc using a laser beam.
It is possible to read the written data as many times as desired.
They keep lasting records of information but access time is high.
It is possible to rewrite updated or new data to another part of the disc.
Data that has already been written cannot be changed.
Usual size – 5.25 inch or 3.5 inch diameter.
The usual capacity of 5.25 inch disk is 650 MB,5.2GB etc.
DVDs

The term “DVD” stands for “Digital Versatile/Video Disc,” and there are two sorts of DVDs:
DVDR (writable)
DVDRW (Re-Writable)
DVD-ROMS (Digital Versatile Discs): These are read-only memory (ROM) discs that can be used in a variety of ways. When compared to CD-ROMs, they can store a lot more data. It has a thick polycarbonate plastic layer that serves as a foundation for the other layers. It’s an optical memory that can read and write data.
DVD-R: DVD-R is a writable optical disc that can be used just once. It’s a DVD that can be recorded. It’s a lot like WORM. DVD-ROMs have capacities ranging from 4.7 to 17 GB. The capacity of 3.5 inch disk is 1.3 GB.
3. Cache Memory
It is a type of high-speed semiconductor memory that can help the CPU run faster. Between the CPU and the main memory, it serves as a buffer. It is used to store the data and programs that the CPU uses the most frequently.

Advantages of Cache Memory

It is faster than the main memory.
When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it.
It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time.
It stores data in temporary use.
Disadvantages of Cache Memory

Because of the semiconductors used, it is very expensive.
The size of the cache (amount of data it can store) is usually small.What is Microprocessor?
A Microprocessor is an important part of a computer architecture without which you will not be able to perform anything on your computer. It is a programmable device that takes in input performs some arithmetic and logical operations over it and produces the desired output. In simple words, a Microprocessor is a digital device on a chip that can fetch instructions from memory, decode and execute them, and give results. Block Diagram of a Microprocessor
A Microprocessor takes a bunch of instructions in machine language and executes them, telling the processor what it has to do. The microprocessor performs three basic things while executing the instruction: 

It performs some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and some logical operations using its Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU). New Microprocessors also perform operations on floating-point numbers. 
Data in microprocessors can move from one location to another. 
It has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the address of the next instruction based on the value of the PC, Microprocessor jumps from one location to another and makes decisions. Types of Processor
Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
CISC or Complex Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture where instructions are such that a single instruction can execute multiple low-level operations like loading from memory, storing into memory, or an arithmetic operation, etc. It has multiple addressing nodes within a single instruction. CISC makes use of very few registers. 

Example of CISC are

Intel 386
Intel 486
Pentium
Pentium Pro
Pentium II
Pentium III
Motorola 68000
Motorola 68020
Motorola 68040 etc.
Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
RISC or Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture where instruction is simple and designed to get executed quickly. Instructions get completed in one clock cycle this is because of the optimization of instructions and pipelining (a technique that allows for simultaneous execution of parts, or stages, of instructions more efficiently process instructions). RISC makes use of multiple registers to avoid large interactions with memory. It has few addressing nodes. Example of RISC are

IBM RS6000.
Decode: When the instruction is entered into the CPU, it needs to decode the instructions. with the help of ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit), the process of decoding begins.
Execute: After the decode step the instructions are ready to execute.
Store: After the execute step the instructions are ready to store in the memory.Types of CPU
We have three different types of CPU:

Single Core CPU: The oldest type of computer CPU is a single-core CPU. These CPUs were used in the 1970s. these CPUs only have a single core that performs different operations. This means that the single-core CPU can only process one operation at a single time. single-core CPU CPU is not suitable for multitasking.
Dual-Core CPU: Dual-Core CPUs contain a single Integrated Circuit with two cores. Each core has its cache and controller. These controllers and cache work as a single unit. dual-core CPUs can work faster than single-core processors.
Quad-Core CPU: Quad-Core CPUs contain two dual-core processors present within a single integrated circuit (IC) or chip. A quad-core processor contains a chip with four independent cores. These cores read and execute various instructions provided by the CPU. Quad Core CPU increases the overall speed of programs. Without even boosting the overall clock speed it results in higher performance.What is CPU Performance?
CPU performance is how fast a computer’s processor (CPU) can complete the task. It is measured by the number of instructions completed in one second. Its performance depends on the processor’s clock speed and other factors like its design and the size of its cache.

What are Computer Programs and Where are They Stored?
A computer program is a set of instructions written by a programmer that tells a computer what to do. For example, Using a web browser or a word processor is a program, Performing math operations on a computer and clicking and selecting items with a mouse or touchpad is also a program.Storage of Programs
There are two ways of storing programs on the computer memory:

Permanent Storage: Programs are stored permanently on storage devices like HDD, or SSD.
Temporary Storage: When a program is running on a CPU, its data is stored in RAM from HDD or SDD. Temporary because RAM is volatile, it loses all data when the power is turned off.Advantages
Versatility: CPU can able to handle a complex task, from basic calculation to managing the operating system.
Performance: Modern CPU are vary fast and able to perform billions of calculation per second.
Multi-core: CPU have multiple core and able to handle multiple task simultaneously.
Compatibility: CPUs are designed to be compatible with a wide range of software, this help to run different applications by using single CPU.Disadvantages
Overheating: CPU generate a lot of heat while performing complex task. This requires effective cooling solutions, such as fans or liquid cooling systems.
Power Consumption: High-performance CPUs can consume a vary high amount of power, which cause to generate higher electricity bills and the need for a robust power supply.
Cost: Best performance CPU can be expensive. Which can be a barrier for some users or applications that need high computing power.
Limited Parallel Processing: While multi-core CPUs can handle multiple tasks at once, they are still not as efficient at parallel processing as specialized hardware like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are designed for handling many tasks simultaneously.Input and Output Devices.An input/output device, often known as an IO device, is any hardware that allows a human operator or other systems to interface with a computer. Input/output devices, as the name implies, are capable of delivering data (output) to and receiving data from a computer (input). An input/output (I/O) device is a piece of hardware that can take, output, or process data. It receives data as input and provides it to a computer, as well as sends computer data to storage media as a storage output.Input Devices
Input devices are the devices that are used to send signals to the computer for performing tasks. The receiver at the end is the CPU (Central Processing Unit), which works to send signals to the output devices. Some of the classifications of Input devices are:

Keyboard Devices
Pointing Devices

Function Keys: The 12 keys from F1 to F12 are on the topmost row of the keyboard.Mouse
The most common pointing device is the mouse. The mouse is used to move a little cursor across the screen while clicking and dragging. The cursor will stop if you let go of the mouse. The computer is dependent on you to move the mouse; it won’t move by itself. As a result, it’s an input device.
A mouse is an input device that lets you move the mouse on a flat surface to control the coordinates and movement of the on-screen cursor/pointer.
The left mouse button can be used to select or move items, while the right mouse button when clicked displays extra menus.Joystick
A joystick is a pointing device that is used to move the cursor on a computer screen. A spherical ball is attached to both the bottom and top ends of the stick. In a socket, the lower spherical ball slides. You can move the joystick in all four directions.The joystick’s function is comparable to that of a mouse. It is primarily used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and playing video games on the computer.

Track Ball.   Track Ball is an accessory for notebooks and laptops, which works on behalf of a mouse. It has a similar structure to a mouse. Its structure is like a half-inserted ball and we use fingers for cursor movement. Different shapes are used for this like balls, buttons, or squares.

Light Pen
A light pen is a type of pointing device that looks like a pen. It can be used to select a menu item or to draw on the monitor screen. A photocell and an optical system are enclosed in a tiny tube. When the tip of a light pen is moved across a monitor screen while the pen button is pushed, the photocell sensor element identifies the screen location and provides a signal to the CPU.Scanner
A scanner is an input device that functions similarly to a photocopier. It’s employed when there’s information on paper that needs to be transferred to the computer’s hard disc for subsequent manipulation. The scanner collects images from the source and converts them to a digital format that may be saved on a disc. Before they are printed, these images can be modified. 
Optical Mark Reader (OMR)
An Optical Mark Reader is a device that is generally used in educational institutions to check the answers to objective exams. It recognizes the marks present by pencil and pen.

Optical Character Reader (OCR)

Magnetic Ink Card Reader (MICR)
It is a device that is generally used in banks to deal with the cheques given to the bank by the customer. It helps in reading the magnetic ink present in the code number and cheque number. This process is very fast compared to any other process.

Bar Code Reader
A bar code reader is a device that reads data that is bar-coded (data that is represented by light and dark lines).Bar-coded data is commonly used to mark things, number books, and so on. It could be a handheld scanner or part of a stationary scanner. A bar code reader scans a bar code image, converts it to an alphanumeric value, and then sends it to the computer to which it is connected.
Web Camera
Because a web camera records a video image of the scene in front of it, a webcam is an input device. It is either built inside the computer (for example, a laptop) or attached through a USB connection. A webcam is a computer-connected tiny digital video camera. It’s also known as a web camera because it can take images and record video. These cameras come with software that must be installed on the computer in order to broadcast video in real-time over the Internet. It can shoot images and HD videos, however, the video quality isn’t as good as other cameras (In Mobiles or other devices or normal cameras).Digitizer
Digitizer is a device that is used to convert analog signals to digital signals. it converts signals into numeric values. An example of a Digitizer is Graphic Tablet, which is used to convert graphics to binary data.

Microphone
The microphone works as an input device that receives input voice signals and also has the responsibility of converting it also to digital form. It is a very common device that is present in every device which is related to music.Output Devices
Output Devices are the devices that show us the result after giving the input to a computer system. Output can be of many different forms like image, graphic audio, video, etc. Some of the output devices are described below.

Monitor
Monitors, also known as Visual Display Units (VDUs), are a computer’s primary output device. It creates images by arranging small dots, known as pixels, in a rectangular pattern. The amount of pixels determines the image’s sharpness. 
The two kinds of viewing screens used for monitors are described below.

Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) Monitor: Pixels are minuscule visual elements that make up a CRT display. The higher the image quality or resolution, the smaller the pixels.
Flat-Panel Display Monitor: In comparison to the CRT, a flat-panel display is a type of video display with less volume, weight, and power consumption. They can be hung on the wall or worn on the wrist.
Flat-panel displays are currently used in calculators, video games, monitors, laptop computers, and graphical displays.Television

Headset
The headset consists of a speaker and microphone where a speaker is an output device and a microphone works as an input device.

Facsimile
A facsimile is a fax machine that consists of a scanner and printer, where the scanner works as an input device and the printer works as an output device.Computer Memory.A computer is an electronic device and that accepts data, processes on that data, and gives the desired output. It performs programmed computation with accuracy and speed. Or in other words, the computer takes data as input and stores the data/instructions in the memory (use them when required). After processes the data, it converts into information. Finally, gives the output.

Here, input refers to the raw data that we want the machine to process and return to us as a result, output refers to the response that the machine provides in response to the raw data entered and the processing of data may involve analyzing, searching, distributing, storing data, etc. Thus, we can also call a computer data processing system.

What is Computer Memory?
Computer memory is just like the human brain. It is used to store data/information and instructions. It is a data storage unit or a data storage device where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. It can store both the input and output can be stored here.

Characteristics of Computer Memory
It is faster computer memory as compared to secondary memory.
It is semiconductor memories.
It is usually a volatile memory, and main memory of the computer.
A computer system cannot run without primary memory.
How Does Computer Memory Work?
When you open a program, it is loaded from secondary memory into primary memory. Because there are various types of memory and storage, an example would be moving a program from a solid-state drive (SSD) to RAM. Because primary storage is accessed more quickly, the opened software can connect with the computer’s processor more quickly. The primary memory is readily accessible from temporary memory slots or other storage sites.

Memory is volatile, which means that data is only kept temporarily in memory. Data saved in volatile memory is automatically destroyed when a computing device is turned off. When you save a file, it is sent to secondary memory for storage.

There are various kinds of memory accessible. It’s operation will depend upon the type of primary memory used. but normally, semiconductor-based memory is more related with memory. Semiconductor memory made up of IC (integrated circuits) with silicon-based metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors.

Types of Computer Memory
In general, computer memory is of three types:

Primary memory
Secondary memory
Cache memory.Now we discuss each type of memory one by one in detail:

1. Primary Memory
It is also known as the main memory of the computer system. It is used to store data and programs or instructions during computer operations. It uses semiconductor technology and hence is commonly called semiconductor memory. Primary memory is of two types:

RAM (Random Access Memory): It is a volatile memory. Volatile memory stores information based on the power supply. If the power supply fails/ interrupted/stopped, all the data and information on this memory will be lost. RAM is used for booting up or start the computer. It temporarily stores programs/data which has to be executed by the processor. RAM is of two types:
S RAM (Static RAM): S RAM uses transistors and the circuits of this memory are capable of retaining their state as long as the power is applied. This memory consists of the number of flip flops with each flip flop storing 1 bit. It has less access time and hence, it is faster.
D RAM (Dynamic RAM): D RAM uses capacitors and transistors and stores the data as a charge on the capacitors. They contain thousands of memory cells. It needs refreshing of charge on capacitor after a few milliseconds. This memory is slower than S RAM.
ROM (Read Only Memory): It is a non-volatile memory. Non-volatile memory stores information even when there is a power supply failed/ interrupted/stopped. ROM is used to store information that is used to operate the system. As its name refers to read-only memory, we can only read the programs and data that is stored on it. It contains some electronic fuses that can be programmed for a piece of specific information. The information stored in the ROM in binary format. It is also known as permanent memory. ROM is of four types:
MROM(Masked ROM): Hard-wired devices with a pre-programmed collection of data or instructions were the first ROMs. Masked ROMs are a type of low-cost ROM that works in this way.
PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory): This read-only memory is modifiable once by the user. The user purchases a blank PROM and uses a PROM program to put the required contents into the PROM. Its content can’t be erased once written.
EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory): EPROM is an extension to PROM where you can erase the content of ROM by exposing it to Ultraviolet rays for nearly 40 minutes.
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory): Here the written contents can be erased electrically. You can delete and reprogramme EEPROM up to 10,000 times. Erasing and programming take very little time, i.e., nearly  4 -10 ms(milliseconds). Any area in an EEPROM can be wiped and programmed selectively.
2. Secondary Memory
It is also known as auxiliary memory and backup memory. It is a non-volatile memory and used to store a large amount of data or information. The data or information stored in secondary memory is permanent, and it is slower than primary memory. A CPU cannot access secondary memory directly. The data/information from the auxiliary memory is first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it.

Characteristics of Secondary Memory

It is a slow memory but reusable.
It is a reliable and non-volatile memory.
It is cheaper than primary memory.
The storage capacity of secondary memory is large.
A computer system can run without secondary memory.
In secondary memory, data is stored permanently even when the power is off.
Types of Secondary Memory

1. Magnetic Tapes: Magnetic tape is a long, narrow strip of plastic film with a thin, magnetic coating on it that is used for magnetic recording. Bits are recorded on tape as magnetic patches called RECORDS that run along many tracks. Typically, 7 or 9 bits are recorded concurrently. Each track has one read/write head, which allows data to be recorded and read as a sequence of characters. It can be stopped, started moving forward or backward, or rewound.

2. Magnetic Disks: A magnetic disk is a circular metal or a plastic plate and these plates are coated with magnetic material. The disc is used on both sides. Bits are stored in magnetized surfaces in locations called tracks that run in concentric rings. Sectors are typically used to break tracks into pieces.",0,0,0,0,1

It is a type of high-speed semiconductor memory that can help the CPU run faster. Between the CPU and the main memory, it serves as a buffer. It is used to store the data and programs that the CPU uses the most frequently.

Advantages of Cache Memory

It is faster than the main memory.
When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it.
It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time.
It stores data in temporary use.
Disadvantages of Cache Memory

Because of the semiconductors used, it is very expensive.
The size of the cache (amount of data it can store) is usually small.Introduction of Microprocessor.In this article we will go through the Microprocessor, we will first define what is a Microprocessor, then we will go through its different types with its block diagram and we will see different types of processors, At last, we will conclude our article with some applications and FAQs.

What is Microprocessor?
A Microprocessor is an important part of a computer architecture without which you will not be able to perform anything on your computer. It is a programmable device that takes in input performs some arithmetic and logical operations over it and produces the desired output. In simple words, a Microprocessor is a digital device on a chip that can fetch instructions from memory, decode and execute them, and give results. 

Block Diagram of a Microprocessor
A Microprocessor takes a bunch of instructions in machine language and executes them, telling the processor what it has to do. The microprocessor performs three basic things while executing the instruction: 

It performs some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and some logical operations using its Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU). New Microprocessors also perform operations on floating-point numbers. 
Data in microprocessors can move from one location to another. 
It has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the address of the next instruction based on the value of the PC, Microprocessor jumps from one location to another and makes decisions. Types of Processor
Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
CISC or Complex Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture where instructions are such that a single instruction can execute multiple low-level operations like loading from memory, storing into memory, or an arithmetic operation, etc. It has multiple addressing nodes within a single instruction. CISC makes use of very few registers. 

Example of CISC are

Intel 386
Intel 486
Pentium
Pentium Pro
Pentium II
Pentium III
Motorola 68000
Motorola 68020
Motorola 68040 etc.
Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
RISC or Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture where instruction is simple and designed to get executed quickly. Instructions get completed in one clock cycle this is because of the optimization of instructions and pipelining (a technique that allows for simultaneous execution of parts, or stages, of instructions more efficiently process instructions). RISC makes use of multiple registers to avoid large interactions with memory. It has few addressing nodes. 

Example of RISC are

IBM RS6000

In this article, we will discuss what is data, the importance of data, and how it played a great role in today’s generation along with that we will discuss what is information and its uses. So, let’s go a little bit deep into this article to understand the concept well. 

Data :
Data is derived from the Latin word “datum” which elaborates “something given”, so data can be defined as crude and unordered facts that need to be processed to make it organized. Although data can be present everywhere in our daily life, it is our responsibility how to collect the data from the different corners and then process the data to get some useful insight from it which can be useful for our particular use. Data can be anything it can be in the form of symbols, characters, numbers, images, etc. Data is always interpreted by humans or machines to make it organized in particular order to derive its meaning.

Wrong Interpretation of data :
There may be chances data can be misinterpreted or misunderstood. Because when the data is been processed the methods or the technique is been followed to interpret the data can be wrong which results in the wrong outcome and if those outcomes will be used for some purpose it will surely lead to failure of the process. So it is very important to take serious steps while processing or manipulating data. Suppose for example in an exam your percentage shows a rise of 10% as compared to the previous attempt but if originally the total marks are less as before so in this case, your marks have underperformed from the last attempt.

Role of Data in Today’s Generation :

Data plays a great role in business organizations to help in making decisions wisely.
Data will provide support to your presentations.
Proper interpretation of data leads to different theories.
Data saves your time by understanding the real problems.
Data help you in guiding whether to invest or not.
Everything you store in today’s world is in the form of data.
Information :
The raw data is collected, after processing this raw data the outcome is information. This information can be defined as when the data is processed, organized, and presented in a specific context to serve its use is called information. The information doesn’t have any existence without data, mostly information have measuring unit like quantity, time, etc. There are also a lot of differences between data and information. For information to be useful, the process data has the following characteristics which are:

Time – Information should be available at any point in time whenever it is required.
Accuracy – Information should be actual and organized only then it can serve its purpose.
Completeness – Information should be finite and consistent.Role of Information in Today’s Generation :

The information helps in generating new information which can be new theories, a new idea’s or new discovery.
The information helps in the duplication of research because it gives an idea of what already has been discovered.
Information technology helps to build and emerge the growth of commerce and business sector and generate maximum possible output.
Information technology has played a great role in the creation of employment.
Data analysts, systems architect, hardware engineer, and software developers, and web designers all beholden their jobs to information technology. Without such advancement, these jobs would not be entertained.Software and its Types. Software is a collection of instructions, data, or computer programs that are used to run machines and carry out particular activities. It is the antithesis of hardware, which refers to a computer’s external components. A device’s running programs, scripts, and applications are collectively referred to as “software” in this context.

What is a Software?
In a computer system, the software is basically a set of instructions or commands that tell a computer what to do. In other words, the software is a computer program that provides a set of instructions to execute a user’s commands and tell the computer what to do. For example like MS-Word, MS-Excel, PowerPoint, etc.

Types of Software
It is a collection of data that is given to the computer to complete a particular task. The chart below describes the types of software.Now we will briefly describe each type and its subtypes:

System Software
Operating System
Language Processor
Device Driver
Application Software
General Purpose Software
Customize Software
Utility Software.System Software
System software is software that directly operates the computer hardware and provides the basic functionality to the users as well as to the other software to operate smoothly. Or in other words, system software basically controls a computer’s internal functioning and also controls hardware devices such as monitors, printers, and storage devices, etc. It is like an interface between hardware and user applications, it helps them to communicate with each other because hardware understands machine language(i.e. 1 or 0) whereas user applications are work in human-readable languages like English, Hindi, German, etc. so system software converts the human-readable language into machine language and vice versa.Types of System Software
It has two subtypes which are:

Operating System: It is the main program of a computer system. When the computer system ON it is the first software that loads into the computer’s memory. Basically, it manages all the resources such as computer memory, CPU, printer, hard disk, etc., and provides an interface to the user, which helps the user to interact with the computer system. It also provides various services to other computer software. Examples of operating systems are Linux, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, etc.
Language Processor: As we know that system software converts the human-readable language into a machine language and vice versa. So, the conversion is done by the language processor. It converts programs written in high-level programming languages like Java, C, C++, Python, etc(known as source code), into sets of instructions that are easily readable by machines(known as object code or machine code).
Device Driver: A device driver is a program or software that controls a device and helps that device to perform its functions. Every device like a printer, mouse, modem, etc. needs a driver to connect with the computer system eternally. So, when you connect a new device with your computer system, first you need to install the driver of that device so that your operating system knows how to control or manage that device.Features of System Software

Utility Software: This type of application software is used to support the computer infrastructure. It is designed to analyze, configure, optimize and maintains the system, and take care of its requirements as well. For example, antivirus, disk fragmenter, memory tester, disk repair, disk cleaners, registry cleaners, disk space analyzer, etc.Features of Application Software
Let us discuss some of the features of Application Software:

An important feature of application software is it performs more specialized tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, email, etc.
Mostly, the size of the software is big, so it requires more storage space.
Application software is more interactive for the users, so it is easy to use and design.
The application software is easy to design and understand.
Application software is written in a high-level language in general.What is an Operating System?.Operating System a type of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware. The operating system is designed in such a way that it can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer. 

Operating System is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and other system software of the computer. Examples of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc.

An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. In this article we will see basic of operating system in detail.

What is an Operating System Used for?
The operating system helps in improving the computer software as well as hardware. Without OS, it became very difficult for any application to be user-friendly. The Operating System provides a user with an interface that makes any application attractive and user-friendly. The operating System comes with a large number of device drivers that make OS services reachable to the hardware environment. Each and every application present in the system requires the Operating System. The operating system works as a communication channel between system hardware and system software. The operating system helps an application with the hardware part without knowing about the actual hardware configuration. It is one of the most important parts of the system and hence it is present in every device, whether large or small device.Functions of the Operating System

Fair Sharing of Resources: Providing efficient and fair sharing of resources between the users and programs.
Types of Operating Systems
Batch Operating System: A Batch Operating System is a type of operating system that does not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator who takes similar jobs having the same requirements and groups them into batches.
Time-sharing Operating System: Time-sharing Operating System is a type of operating system that allows many users to share computer resources (maximum utilization of the resources).
Distributed Operating System: Distributed Operating System is a type of operating system that manages a group of different computers and makes appear to be a single computer. These operating systems are designed to operate on a network of computers. They allow multiple users to access shared resources and communicate with each other over the network. Examples include Microsoft Windows Server and various distributions of Linux designed for servers.
Network Operating System: Network Operating System is a type of operating system that runs on a server and provides the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions.
Real-time Operating System: Real-time Operating System is a type of operating system that serves a real-time system and the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small.

They are used for high-performance computing and for applications that require high availability and reliability. Examples include Rocks Cluster Distribution and OpenMPI.How to Choose the Operating System?
There are so many factors to be considered while choosing the best Operating System for our use. These factors are mentioned below.

Price Factor: Price is one of the factors to choose the correct Operating System as there are some OS that is free, like Linux, but there is some more OS that is paid like Windows and macOS.
Accessibility Factor: Some Operating Systems are easy to use like macOS and iOS, but some OS are a little bit complex to understand like Linux. So, you must choose the Operating System in which you are more accessible. 
Compatibility factor: Some Operating Systems support very less applications whereas some Operating Systems supports more application. You must choose the OS, which supports the applications which are required by you.
Security Factor: The security Factor is also a factor in choosing the correct OS, as macOS provide some additional security while Windows has little fewer security features.Basic Concept Of Number System.Number System:- 

The number system is defined as the use of numbers and symbols in arithmetic and algebraic expressions. It is used in arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and also covers Arithmetic and geometric progression. It is also used in simplification by using VBODMAS where V stands for vinculum, B stands for the bracket, O stands for of, D stands for division, M stands for multiplication, A stands for addition, and S stands for subtraction.Types of Numbers:- 


There are various types of numbers in the number system. Detail explanation is given below:



Integers:- The numbers which are positive and negative, including 0 are termed Integers. -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5 are integers.

Natural Numbers:- Numbers that start with 1,2,3……so on are called Natural Numbers. Zero, negative numbers, and decimals are not counted as natural numbers. 

Whole Numbers:- Numbers start with zero (0,1,2,3…….) all whole numbers. All the natural numbers are whole numbers, but all the whole numbers are not natural numbers. 

Rational Numbers:- The numbers which are repeating, terminating, and can be written in the form of p/q form where p and q are integers and q shouldn’t be zero are called Rational Numbers. For example 0.676767

Irrational Numbers:- The numbers which are non-repeating, non-terminating, and can’t be written in the form of p/q form where p and q are integers and q shouldn’t be zero are called Irrational Numbers. For example 3.14159…

Prime Numbers:- The numbers which are divisible by 1 and the number itself are called Prime Numbers. For example: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17 etc.

Composite Numbers:- The numbers which have more than two divisors of the numbers other than prime numbers are called Composite Numbers. For example: 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15 etc.

Co-prime Numbers:- The pair of numbers which do not have common factors except 1 are called Co-prime Numbers. For example, 3 and 5, 7 and 11, etc.

Complex Numbers:- The numbers which are formed by a real number and an imaginary number are called Complex Numbers. The Standard Form of a complex number is A+?B where A is a real number and B is an imaginary number.
Relation Between Divisor, Dividend, Quotient and Reminder in a Division Sum:

  
Dividend = Divisor*Quotient + Reminder

 ASCII Values Alphabets ( A-Z, a-z & Special Character Table ).ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard character encoding used in telecommunication. The ASCII pronounced ‘ask-ee’, is strictly a seven-bit code based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes are used to represent alphanumeric data.

The code was first published as a standard in 1967. it was subsequently updated and published as ANSI X3.4-1968, then as ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally as ANSI X3.4-1986. Since it is a seven-bit code, it can at the most represent 128 characters. it currently defines 95 printable characters including 26 upper case letters (A to Z), 26 lower case letters, 10 numerals (0 to 9), and 33 special characters including mathematical symbols, punctuation marks, and space characters. They represent text in, telecommunications equipment, and devices. These include numbers, upper and lowercase English letters, functions, punctuation symbols, and some other symbols.

In total, there are 256 ASCII characters, and can be broadly divided into three categories:

ASCII control characters (0-31 and 127)
ASCII printable characters (32-126) (most commonly referred to)
Extended ASCII characters (128-255)
What is ASCII Value?
 ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, A character encoding standard that assigns unique numerical values to letters, digits, punctuation marks, and other symbols.

Why do we need ASCII Value representation?
In the physical world, you would use a pen and paper to write the message, and your friend would read the text directly. However, when it comes to digital communication, computers don’t understand letters and symbols the way humans do. Instead, they process information in the form of binary code, which consists of 0s and 1s. This is where ASCII values come into play.

ASCII values serve as a bridge between human-readable text and computer-readable binary code. Each character, whether it’s a letter, number, or symbol, is assigned a unique ASCII value ranging from 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII value of the uppercase letter ‘A’ is 65, while the lowercase letter ‘a’ has an ASCII value of 97. Similarly, the digit ‘0’ has an ASCII value of 48.

How Computers Use ASCII to Understand Human Text?
Suppose you want to send a text message to your friend that reads, “Hello!” When you type this message on your phone or computer, each character is converted into its corresponding ASCII value. In this case, the ASCII values for “Hello!” are 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, and 33.",0,0,0,0,1
52,Computer Systems and Organisation,"ISCII Encoding
ISCII is an acronym for Indian Script Code for Information Interchange. ISCII is an encoding scheme that represents various languages that are written and spoken in India. ISCII follows single encoding schema, which allows for easy transliteration between various writing systems.

ISCII was introduced in the year 1991 by the Bureau of Indian Standards(BIS). It follows an 8-bit encoding schema and contains about 256 characters. The first 128 characters, that is, from 0-127 are same as that for ASCII. The next characters, that are from 128-255 represent the characters from the Indian scripts. Most of the Indian language characters are taken from the ancient Brahmi script and resemble close to each other due to having similar phonetic structure. Hence, a common character set was possible.

Advantages :

Majority of languages that are spoken in India are represented in this.
Character set is simple and easy to understand.
Easy transliteration between languages is possible.
Disadvantages :

We need a special keyboard which contains ISCII character keys.
As the Unicode was invented later, and with Unicode having the characters of ISCII, ISCII became obsolete.Unicode in Computer Network
Last Updated : 22 Mar, 2023
Unicode is a universal encoding system to provide a comprehensive character set and was created by the Unicode Consortium (a group of multilingual software manufacturers). Unicode simplifies software localization and improves multilingual text processing. It overcomes the difficulty inherent in ASCII and extended ASCII. Unicode has standardizes script behavior which allows any combination of characters, drawn from any combination of scripts and languages, to co-exist in a single document. Unicode defines multiple encodings of its single character set: UTF-7, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. Conversion of data among these encodings is lossless. Unicode was originally a 2-byte character set. Unicode version 3, however, is a 4-byte code and is fully compatible with ASCII and extended ASCII. These all support encoding the same set of characters.

UTF-8 uses anywhere from 1 to 4 bytes per character depending on character, but ASCII take only 1 byte and 4 bytes for unusual ones.
UTF-16 uses 2 bytes for most characters, while very unusual characters take 4.
UTF-32 uses 4 bytes per character. We can calculate the number of characters in a UTF-32 string by only counting bytes.
The notation uses hexadecimal digits in format as follows. U-XXXXXXXX – The numbering goes from U-00000000 to U-FFFFFFFF. Unicode divides the available space codes into planes. A plane is a continuous group of 65,536 code points. The most significant 16 bits define the plane (i.e. number of planes = 65,535) and each plane can define up to 65,536 characters or symbols. Types of Plane –

Basic multilingual plane (BMP) – Plane 0000, the basic multilingual plane is designed to be compatible with the previous 16-bit Unicode. The most significant 16-bits in this plane are all zeroes. It mostly defines character sets in different languages with the exception of some control and special characters. It is represented as U+XXXX where XXXX is the least significant 16-bits, eig.,: U+0900 to U+09FF reserved for Devanagari, Bengali U+2200 to U+22FF reserved for a mathematical operation etc.
Supplementary multilingual plane (SMP) – Plane 0001, the supplementary multilingual plane, is designed to provide more codes for those multilingual characters that are excluded in the BMP. Example: 10140-1018F are reserved for Ancient Greek Numbers.
Supplementary ideography plane (SIP) – Plane 0002, the supplementary ideography plane, is designed to provide codes for ideographic symbols, symbols that provide an idea in contrast to a sound, e.g., 20000-2A6DF are reserved for CJK Unified Extension B
Supplementary special plane (SSP) – 000E, the supplementary special plane, is used for special characters, e.g., E0000-E007F are reserved for tags.
Private use planes (PUPs) – Planes 000F and 0010, private use planes are for private use. They are used by fonts internally to refer to auxiliary glyphs.
Advantages:
Universal character set: Unicode supports almost all the characters and symbols used in the world’s writing systems, making it a universal character set that can be used to represent text in any language.

Interoperability: Unicode provides interoperability between different computing systems, platforms, and software applications. This means that text encoded in Unicode can be exchanged and displayed correctly across different systems, regardless of the language or script used.

Compatibility: Unicode is compatible with all the major computing platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. This makes it easy to share and display text across different devices and platforms.

Efficient storage: Unicode uses a fixed-length encoding scheme, which makes it more efficient in terms of storage and memory usage than other encoding standards.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: Unicode is a complex encoding standard that can be difficult to implement and use correctly. It requires a significant amount of knowledge and expertise to correctly encode, store, and display text in Unicode.

Compatibility issues with legacy systems: Some legacy systems and software applications may not support Unicode or may not display Unicode characters correctly. This can cause compatibility issues when exchanging text across different systems.

Large character set: Unicode’s large character set can be a disadvantage in some applications, where only a small subset of characters is needed. This can result in larger file sizes and increased memory usage.

Localization: While Unicode supports most of the world’s writing systems, it may not be sufficient for some localization requirements, such as the need for specialized symbols or characters that are unique to a particular language or culture.<meta charset=”utf-8?> vs <meta http-equiv=”Content-Type”>.<meta charset=”utf-8?> is an HTML tag that is used to indicate the web page’s character encoding. In order to see the correct content, the tag’s function is used which let the browser know what character encoding was used in the HTML document. The tag is located in the document’s head. The utf-8 is an encoding character set that contains almost all the characters that are used in writing systems worldwide. Text, symbols, and special characters can be correctly decoded and displayed with the help of the browser regardless of the language. The <meta charset=”utf-8?> provides the character encoding used for the writing system. This guarantees that the material can be read and understood by users worldwide and it is shown consistently across various devices and platforms.What is Character Encoding System?.As we all know, computers do not understand the English alphabet, numbers except 0 and 1, or text symbols. We use encoding to convert these. So, encoding is the method or process of converting a series of characters, i.e, letters, numbers, punctuation, and symbols into a special or unique format for transmission or storage in computers. Data is represented in computers using ASCII, UTF8, UTF32, ISCII, and Unicode encoding schemes. All types of data, including numbers, text, photos, audio, and video files, can be handled by computers. For example, 65 is represented as A because all the characters, symbols, numbers are assigned some unique code by the standard encoding schemes. Some of the commonly used encoding schemes are described below:

1. ASCII: ASCII is known as American Standard Code for Information Interchange. The X3 group, part of the ASA, produced and published ASCII for the first time in 1963. (American Standards Association). The ASCII standard was first published in 1963 as ASA X3.4-1963, and it was revised ten times between 1967 and 1986. ASCII is an 8-bit code standard that divides the 256 slots into letters, numbers, and other characters. The ASCII decimal (Dec) number is constructed using binary, which is the universal computer language. The decimal value of the lowercase “h” character (char) is 104, which is “01101000” in binary.

The ASCII table is broken down into three sections.

Non-printable, system codes between 0 and 31.
Lower ASCII, between 32 and 127.
Higher ASCII, between 128 and 255. ISCII: ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange) is the abbreviation for the Indian Script Code for Information Interchange. ISCII is a method of encoding that can be used to encode a wide range of Indian languages, both written and spoken. To ease transliteration across multiple writing systems, ISCII adopts a single encoding mechanism.

ISCII was established in 1991 by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). It has a character count of roughly 256 and employs an 8-bit encoding technique. From 0-127, the first 128 characters are the same as in ASCII. The following characters, which range from 128 to 255, represent characters from Indian scripts.

Advantages include:

The vast majority of Indian languages are represented in this.
The character set is simple and straightforward.
It is possible to easily transliterate between languages.
Disadvantages include:

A special keyboard with ISCII character keys is required.
Because Unicode was created later, and Unicode included ISCII characters, ISCII became obsolete.ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange) is the Indian Script Code for Information Interchange.
ISCII is a method of encoding that can encode a wide range of Indian languages, both written and spoken. To ease transliteration across multiple writing systems, ISCII adopts a single encoding mechanism.
3. Unicode:  Unicode Characters are translated and stored in computer systems as numbers (bit sequences) that the processor can handle. In Unicode, a code page is an encoding system that converts a set of bits into a character representation. Hundreds of different encoding techniques allocated a number to each letter or character in the globe before Unicode. Many of these methods used code pages with only 256 characters and each of which required 8 bits of storage. 

Unicode enables the creation of a single software product or website for multiple platforms, languages, and countries (without re-engineering), resulting in significant cost savings over older character sets.
Unicode data can be used without generating data corruption in a variety of systems.
Unicode is a universal encoding technique that can be used to encode any language or letter irrespective of devices, operating systems, or software.
Unicode is a character encoding standard that allows you to convert between multiple character encoding systems. Because Unicode is a superset of all other major character encoding systems, you can convert from one encoding scheme to Unicode and then from Unicode to a different encoding scheme.
The most extensively used encoding is Unicode.
The applicable versions of ISO/IEC 10646, which defines the Universal Character Set character encoding, are fully compatible and synchronized with Unicode Standard versions. Or we can say that it includes 96,447 character codes that are far enough to decode any character symbol present in the world.
4. UTF-8: It is a character encoding with variable widths that are used in electronic communication. With one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units, it can encode all 1,112,064[nb 1] valid Unicode character code points. Code points with lower numerical values are encoded with fewer bytes since they occur more frequently. When it was created the creators make sure that this encoding scheme is ASCII compatible and the first 128 Unicode characters that are one-to-one to ASCII are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII and ensure that ASCII text is also valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode.UTF-32: UTF-32 is known as 32-bit Unicode Transformation Format. It is a fixed-length encoding that encodes Unicode code points using 32 bits per code. It uses 4-bytes per character and we can count the number of characters in UTF-32 string simply by just counting bytes. The main advantage of using UTF-32 is that Unicode code points can be directly indexed (although letters in general, such as “grapheme clusters” or some emojis, cannot be directly indexed, thus determining the displayed width of a string is more complex). A constant-time operation is finding the Nth code point in a sequence of code points. On the other hand, a variable-length code necessitates sequential access to locate the Nth code point in a row. As a result, UTF-32 is a straightforward substitute for ASCII code that examines each issue in a string using numbers incremented by one.",0,0,0,0,1
