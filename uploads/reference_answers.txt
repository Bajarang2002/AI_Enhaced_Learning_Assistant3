1. Define UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE?
Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the
 value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).



2.Explain in detail WAVE–PARTICLE DUALITY?
Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately
 the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).


3.What do you mean by QUANTUM CHEMISTRy?	
[2]: 1.1  It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.


4.Write a short note on INFORMATION SCIENCE.	

It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.
